# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to the Qiskit Textbook! The general process is:

0. Install the software
1. Download a copy of the Textbook
2. Make the changes you want to see
3. Upload your changes and request to merge them into the Textbook (known as a
   _pull request_).

## 0. Installation

You'll need some software installed to work on this repository (repo). We can
install some packages for you automatically, but you must install the
following packages manually. We recommend doing this first.

> <details>
>   <summary>MacOS install instructions</summary>
> 
>   We recommend installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage your
>   installations. You can think of Homebrew as an app store. This saves you
>   from using each program's manual installer, and makes updating and
>   uninstalling easier.
>   
>   With Homebrew installed, you can open a terminal and run:
>   
>   ```bash
>   brew install python@3.8 git direnv vale
>   ```
>   
>   The only thing Homebrew _can't_ install is GitHub Desktop, which we
>   recommend to first-time contributors. Please go to the [GitHub Desktop
>   download page](https://desktop.github.com/) to install manually.
>   
>   You may also want to hook `direnv` into your shell (see [guide](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).
>   Once complete, you can skip to [the next step](#2-fork--download-the-textbook).
>   
> </details>

Software used:
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/): To run Qiskit and Jupyter notebook.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com): To save and share your changes. If using Windows,
  choose to install Bash when asked by the installer.
- [Direnv](https://direnv.net/): To automatically switch environments when in
  this directory.
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) _or_ [GitHub
  CLI](https://cli.github.com/): To easily work with github.com. If you're new
  to Git, we recommend the desktop application.
- [Vale linter](https://vale.sh/): Used for one of the tests.


## 1. Fork & download the Textbook

### 1.1 Fork

For your first contribution, you'll need to _fork_ the Textbook repository by
clicking [this link](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/fork), this will take
you to a new page. Click _Create fork_. This creates a copy of the repo, owned
by your GitHub account.

### 1.2 Clone

Now, you can download (clone) your forked repository. For GitHub Desktop users,
make sure you're looking at the web page for your fork (the url will be
`github.com/<your-user-name>/textbook`, _not_ `github.com/Qiskit/textbook`). Then
click the green _code_ button and choose _Open with GitHub Desktop_.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36071638/212101928-2e8d5119-b024-4000-a00a-07989187713a.png" width="350px">

Then click _clone_. This will download the textbook repo to a folder on your
computer. If you use GitHub Desktop, this folder will be at
`Documents/GitHub/textbook`.

### 1.3 Setup

Next, install the specific packages we use in the Textbook and set up your
environment. To set up automatically, first open a terminal in the repo folder.

> ℹ️  GitHub Desktop users can do this through the app by going to _Repository >
> Open in Terminal_.

with your terminal in this folder, run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

> <details>
>   <summary> What does this do? </summary>
>   <br>
>   <p>If you're interested, this script will:</p>
> 
>   <ul>
>     <li>
>       Setup a Python venv with the correct version of Python, and add a shell
>       script to automatically switch to this venv when you move to this directory.
>     </li>
>     <li>
>       Set up your IPython & Jupyter config so that your notebook outputs match
>       those already in the Textbook.
>     </li>
>     <li>
>       Set up Git commit hooks that lint the notebooks to adhere to our conventions
>       (this helps with reviewing PRs and merge conflicts).
>     </li>
>   </ul>
> </details>

This may take a while. When it's finished, you'll see `Qiskit Textbook setup
complete!`


## 2. Making changes to the Textbook

The source for each page in the Textbook is a [Jupyter
notebook](https://jupyter.org/), a file format that combines
[Python](https://www.python.org/) code,
[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and rich content (e.g.
images). To contribute to the Qiskit Textbook, you must edit these
notebooks, then share your changes with us via GitHub.

### 2.1 Making a new branch

First, make a new branch named after the changes you plan on
making (for example, `fix-issue-544`).

> ℹ️ GitHub Desktop users can do this through the app. See  [Managing
> branches](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches)
> for more information.

### 2.2 Editing notebooks

Once on the appropriate branch, you can edit a notebook by navigating to this
repo in a terminal and running

```
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m notebook
```

This will open Jupyter notebook, which you can use to make your changes.
Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk?t=243) if you're unfamiliar
with notebooks.

The Qiskit Textbook also includes some extra features that we can't display in
the notebook editor. We use a special syntax to tell the Textbook website where
and how to insert these features. (TODO: include more about this).

### 2.3 Saving your changes

Once you've made your changes, you must save (commit) them using Git.

> ℹ️ GitHub Desktop users: see [Committing and reviewing changes to your
project](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project).

> :warning: If you get an error when comitting through GitHub Desktop, use the workaround below.
> <details>
>   <summary>Workaround</summary>
>     <p>We run some scripts on commit to search for common problems in notebooks, but
>     sometimes GitHub Desktop can't find these scripts. To fix, you'll need to
>     open the application from the textbook folder.</p>
>     <ol>
>     <li>Install the CLI tool (Go to the application menu and choose <i>Install
>     Command Line Tool</i>),</li>
>     <li>open a terminal in the repo (<i>Repository > Open in Terminal</i>),</li>
>     <li>close GitHub Desktop,</li>
>     <li>run the <code>github</code> command in the terminal,</li>
>     </ol>
>     <p>then continue committing your changes.</p>
> </details>

## 3. Make a pull request

With your changes made and committed, you can now push these changes to GitHub,
and ask us to consider incorporating them into the Textbook.

> ℹ️ GitHub Desktop users: see [Pushing changes to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github)

After pushing your changes, switch back to the `main` branch
before working on a different issue.

## Testing

When you submit a pull request, we'll run some tests against your changes.
You can read more about them in the [`tests folder`](./tests).

# Qiskit Textbook Localization

First of all, **thank you** for showing interest in translating (localizing) Qiskit Textbook! Your effort helps make the textbook more accessible and available to our global community.

**Please note that you must sign up separately if you want to join the localization project for [Qiskit Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/). For signing up to join the Qiskit Documentation Localization project, please refer the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-translations/blob/master/README.md).**

If you are interested in contributing to translating the Qiskit Textbook, please follow the instructions below.</br>

## Steps to participate in Qiskit textbook translations:

1. Open the [LOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/blob/main/LOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS) file. Look for the language header that you'd like to contribute to and add your full name under the header. If you do not find the language that you'd like to contribute to, please read [this section](#how-to-add-a-new-language).<br/>
2. Create a pull request (PR) to add your name to the list. Make sure to follow the template to open a PR.<br/>
Each contributor must create their own PR and sign the Contributors License Agreement (CLA). (see #3 below).
If you have an open issue for a language request, **add the issue link to the PR**.

   _(Not sure how to open a PR? Checkout [this section](#how-to-add-my-name-to-textbook_contributors-list-and-open-a-pr-in-github))_
   
3. When you conribute to a Qiskit open source project on GitHub with a new pull request, a bot will evaluate whether you have signed the [Qiskit Contribution License Agreement (CLA)](https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-cla.pdf). If it is your first time contributing to Qiskit, you will be prompted to sign the CLA in your PR. Please make sure to sign the CLA by accepting the agreement.<br/>
4. Join [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com) using the same GitHub ID you used to open your PR above.  
5. Leave a comment in your PR stating that you successfully joined GitLocalize.
6. Once your PR has been accepted and merged, you will receive a notification from GitLocalize with a title: `[GitLocalize] You have been assigned a new role.`<br/>
7. Join project [Qiskit/textbook] and then visit the language you signed up to contribute to.<br/>
8. For questions about the project, to connect with other translators, or to receive updates regarding the project, please join #qiskit-localization channel in the [Qiskit workspace](https://qisk.it/join-slack). <br/>

## Review the CLA document

The [Qiskit Contribution License Agreement (CLA)](https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-cla.pdf) document is also available for review as PDF.

## What is GitLocalize?

[GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com) is a platform for managing translations of the content stored on GitHub and simplifies the translation workflow for developers.

Important note:<br/>
Gitlocalize is under active development, so you may encounter issues during translation. If you find bugs or errors, please feel free to reach out to translation leads or open an issue [here](https://github.com/gitlocalize/gitlocalize-ibm/issues). 


## How to add a new language?

If you want to add a new language and become a translation lead, you can open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/issues/new/choose) to start a discussion with the Qiskit team and recruit translation project members. Please refer to the [criteria](#what-is-the-criteria-for-adding-a-new-language?) below to receive official support from the administrators for new languages.


## What is the criteria for adding a new language?

1. A minimum of **three contributors** is necessary for any new language to be added and receive official support from the administrators of the Qiskit Textbook localization project.<br/>
2. In addition to translators, we will need **dedicated proof-readers** to review the translations and approve accuracy of content in that language, to ensure the translations can be released in that language.<br/>
3. Among the group of contributors, a **translation lead must be identified** to serve as a liaison with the administrators of the localization project. The lead must contact [Soolu Thomas](mailto:soolu.thomas@ibm.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Qiskit%20Documentation%20Translation) and [Yuri Kobayashi](mailto:yurik@jp.ibm.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Qiskit%20Documentation%20Translation) by email for the language to be officially listed under this project. <br/>

These are general guidelines for joining translation efforts and adding new languages.
However, please note that the above does not guarantee that a language will be opened.
If you have further questions, please feel free to contact [Soolu Thomas](mailto:soolu.thomas@ibm.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Qiskit%20Documentation%20Translation) and [Yuri Kobayashi](mailto:yurik@jp.ibm.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Qiskit%20Documentation%20Translation). Thank you.

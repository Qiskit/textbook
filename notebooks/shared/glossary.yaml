qubit:
  title: Qubit
  text: |
    A __qubit__ or __quantum bit__ is the basic unit of quantum information.
    It is a two-state quantum-mechanical system, and one of the simplest systems
    displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics.

    Quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superposition of both
    states simultaneously, a property which is fundamental to quantum mechanics
    and quantum computing.

    "\n",
    "Quantum computing requires us to encode information in qubits. Most quantum algorithms developed over the past few decades have assumed that these qubits are perfect: they can be prepared in any state we desire, and be manipulated with complete precision. Qubits that obey these assumptions are often known as *logical qubits*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last few decades have also seen great advances in finding physical systems that behave as qubits, with better quality qubits being developed all the time. However, the imperfections can never be removed entirely. These qubits will always be much too imprecise to serve directly as logical qubits. Instead, we refer to them as *physical qubits*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current era of quantum computing, we seek to use physical qubits despite their imperfections, by designing custom algorithms and using error mitigation effects. For the future era of fault-tolerance, however, we must find ways to build logical qubits from physical qubits. This will be done through the process of quantum error correction, in which logical qubits are encoded in a large number of physical qubits. The encoding is maintained by constantly putting the physical qubits through a highly entangling circuit. Auxilliary degrees of freedom are also constantly measured, to detect signs of errors and allow their effects to be removed. The operations on the logical qubits required to implement quantum computation will be performed by essentially making small perturbations to this procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the vast amount of effort required for this process, most operations performed in fault-tolerant quantum computers will be done to serve the purpose of error detection and correction. So when benchmarking our progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computation, we must keep track of how well our devices perform error correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will look at a particular example of error correction: the repetition code. Though not a true example of quantum error correction - it uses physical qubits to encode a logical *bit*, rather than a qubit - it serves as a simple guide to all the basic concepts in any quantum error correcting code. We will also see how it can be run on current prototype devices."

    "### The basics of error correction\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic ideas behind error correction are the same for quantum information as for classical information. This allows us to begin by considering a very straightforward example: speaking on the phone. If someone asks you a question to which the answer is 'yes' or 'no', the way you give your response will depend on two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How important is it that you are understood correctly?\n",
    "* How good is your connection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these can be paramaterized with probabilities. For the first, we can use $P_a$, the maximum acceptable probability of being misunderstood. If you are being asked to confirm a preference for ice cream flavours, and don't mind too much if you get vanilla rather than chocolate, $P_a$ might be quite high. If you are being asked a question on which someone's life depends, however, $P_a$ will be much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second we can use $p$, the probability that your answer is garbled by a bad connection. For simplicity, let's imagine a case where a garbled 'yes' doesn't simply sound like nonsense, but sounds like a 'no'. And similarly a 'no' is transformed into 'yes'. Then $p$ is the probability that you are completely misunderstood.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good connection or a relatively unimportant question will result in $p<P_a$. In this case it is fine to simply answer in the most direct way possible: you just say 'yes' or 'no'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, however, your connection is poor and your answer is important, we will have $p>P_a$. A single 'yes' or 'no' is not enough in this case. The probability of being misunderstood would be too high. Instead we must encode our answer in a more complex structure, allowing the receiver to decode our meaning despite the possibility of the message being disrupted. The simplest method is the one that many would do without thinking: simply repeat the answer many times. For example say 'yes, yes, yes' instead of 'yes' or 'no, no no' instead of 'no'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the receiver hears 'yes, yes, yes' in this case, they will of course conclude that the sender meant 'yes'. If they hear 'no, yes, yes', 'yes, no, yes' or 'yes, yes, no', they will probably conclude the same thing, since there is more positivity than negativity in the answer. To be misunderstood in this case, at least two of the replies need to be garbled. The probability for this, $P$, will be less than $p$. When encoded in this way, the message therefore becomes more likely to be understood. The code cell below shows an example of this."

The fact that $P<p$ above comes from the fact that we need at least two replies to be garbled to flip the majority, and so even the most likely possibilities have a probability of $\\sim p^2$. For five repetitions we'd need at least three replies to be garbled to flip the majority, which happens with probability $\\sim p^3$. The value for $P$ in this case would then be even lower. Indeed, as we increase the number of repetitions, $P$ will decrease exponentially. No matter how bad the connection, or how certain we need to be of our message getting through correctly, we can achieve it by just repeating our answer enough times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this is a simple example, it contains all the aspects of error correction.\n",
    "* There is some information to be sent or stored: In this case, a 'yes' or 'no.\n",
    "* The information is encoded in a larger system to protect it against noise: In this case, by repeating the message.\n",
    "* The information is finally decoded, mitigating for the effects of noise: In this case, by trusting the majority of the transmitted messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This same encoding scheme can also be used for binary, by simply substituting `0` and `1` for 'yes' and 'no. It can therefore also be easily generalized to qubits by using the states $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$. In each case it is known as the *repetition code*. Many other forms of encoding are also possible in both the classical and quantum cases, which outperform the repetition code in many ways. However, its status as the simplest encoding does lend it to certain applications. One is exactly what it is used for in Qiskit: as the first and simplest test of implementing the ideas behind quantum error correction."

    "\n",
    "We will now implement these ideas explicitly using Qiskit. To see the effects of imperfect qubits, we simply can use the qubits of the prototype devices. We can also reproduce the effects in simulations. The function below creates a simple noise model in order to do this. These go beyond the simple case discussed earlier, of a single noise event which happens with a probability $p$. Instead we consider two forms of error that can occur. One is a gate error: an imperfection in any operation we perform. We model this here in a simple way, using so-called depolarizing noise. The effect of this will be, with probability $p_{gate}$ ,to replace the state of any qubit with a completely random state. For two qubit gates, it is applied independently to each qubit. The other form of noise is that for measurement. This simply flips between a `0` to a `1` and vice-versa immediately before measurement with probability $p_{meas}$."

    "\n",
    "So far, we have considered cases where there is no delay between encoding and decoding. For qubits, this means that there is no significant amount of time that passes between initializing the circuit, and making the final measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many cases for which there will be a significant delay. As an obvious example, one may wish to encode a quantum state and store it for a long time, like a quantum hard drive. A less obvious but much more important example is performing fault-tolerant quantum computation itself. For this, we need to store quantum states and preserve their integrity during the computation. This must also be done in a way that allows us to manipulate the stored information in any way we need, and which corrects any errors we may introduce when performing the manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, we need account for the fact that errors do not only occur when something happens (like a gate or measurement), they also occur when the qubits are idle. Such noise is due to the fact that the qubits interact with each other and their environment. The longer we leave our qubits idle for, the greater the effects of this noise becomes. If we leave them for long enough, we'll encounter a situation like the $p_{meas}=0.5$ case above, where the noise is too strong for errors to be reliably corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to keep measuring throughout. No qubit is left idle for too long. Instead, information is constantly being extracted from the system to keep track of the errors that have occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of classical information, where we simply wish to store a `0` or `1`, this can be done by just constantly measuring the value of each qubit. By keeping track of when the values change due to noise, we can easily deduce a history of when errors occurred. \n",
    "\n",

    "With the repetition encoding that we are using, a z measurement (which distinguishes between the $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ states) of the logical qubit is done using a z measurement of each physical qubit. The final result for the logical measurement is decoded from the physical qubit measurement results by simply looking which output is in the majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, we can keep track of errors on logical qubits that are stored for a long time by constantly performing z measurements of the physical qubits. However, note that this effectively corresponds to constantly performing z measurements of the physical qubits. This is fine if we are simply storing a `0` or `1`, but it has undesired effects if we are storing a superposition. Specifically: the first time we do such a check for errors, we will collapse the superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not ideal. If we wanted to do some computation on our logical qubit, or if we wish to perform a basis change before final measurement, we need to preserve the superposition. Destroying it is an error. But this is not an error caused by imperfections in our devices. It is an error that we have introduced as part of our attempts to correct errors. And since we cannot hope to recreate any arbitrary superposition stored in our quantum computer, it is an error that cannot be corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we must find another way of keeping track of the errors that occur when our logical qubit is stored for long times. This should give us the information we need to detect and correct errors, and to decode the final measurement result with high probability. However, it should not cause uncorrectable errors to occur during the process by collapsing superpositions that we need to preserve.\n",

The ancilla qubit is always initialized in state $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$. The code qubits, however, can be initialized in different states.

Specifically, it looks at the two code qubits and determines whether their state is the same or different in the z basis. For basis states that are the same in the z basis, like $\\left|00\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|11\\right\\rangle$, the measurement simply returns `0`. It also does so for any superposition of these. Since it does not distinguish between these states in any way, it also does not collapse such a superposition.\n",

If their state is described by a repeated $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$, a repeated $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$, or any superposition thereof, all the syndrome measurements will return `0`. Given this result, we will know that our states are indeed encoded in the repeated states that we want them to be, and can deduce that no errors have occurred. If some syndrome measurements return `1`, however, it is a signature of an error. We can therefore use these measurement results to determine how to decode the result."

    "Our task when confronted with any of the possible outcomes we see here is to determine what the outcome should have been, if there was no noise. For an outcome of `'000 00'` or `'111 00'`, the answer is obvious. These are the results we just saw for a logical `0` and logical `1`, respectively, when no errors occur. The former is the most common outcome for the logical `0` even with noise, and the latter is the most common for the logical `1`. We will therefore conclude that the outcome was indeed that for logical `0` whenever we encounter `'000 00'`, and the same for logical `1` when we encounter `'111 00'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this tactic is optimal, it can nevertheless fail. Note that `'111 00'` typically occurs in a handful of cases for an encoded `0`, and `'000 00'` similarly occurs for an encoded `1`. In this case, through no fault of our own, we will incorrectly decode the output. In these cases, a large number of errors conspired to make it look like we had a noiseless case of the opposite logical value, and so correction becomes impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can employ a similar tactic to decode all other outcomes. The outcome `'001 00'`, for example, occurs far more for a logical `0` than a logical `1`. This is because it could be caused by just a single measurement error in the former case (which incorrectly reports a single `0` to be `1`), but would require at least two errors in the latter. So whenever we see `'001 00'`, we can decode it as a logical `0`.\n",

    "Applying this tactic over all the strings is a form of so-called 'lookup table decoding'. This is where every possible outcome is analyzed, and the most likely value to decode it as is determined. For many qubits, this quickly becomes intractable, as the number of possible outcomes becomes so large. In these cases, more algorithmic decoders are needed. However, lookup table decoding works well for testing out small codes.\n",

This causes it to disagree with both neighboring code qubits for the rest of the circuit. This is shown by the syndrome in the first round, but the blocks for subsequent rounds do not report it as it no longer represents a change.

However, since this disagreed with the previous result for the same syndrome measurement, and since we track syndrome changes, this change results in another `1`. Subsequent rounds also do not detect anything, but this no longer represents a change and hence results in a `0` in the same position. Most likely the measurement result leading to the first `1` was an error.\n",

    "**Example 3:** `0 1  0000 0001 0000` represents a $d=5$, $T=2$ repetition code with encoded `1`. A code qubit on the end of the line is flipped before the second round of syndrome measurements. This is detected by only a single syndrome measurement, because it is on the end of the line. For the same reason, it also disturbs one of the logical readouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in all these examples, a single error causes exactly two characters in the string to change from the value they would have with no errors. This is the defining feature of the convention used to represent stabilizers in `topological_codes`. It is used to define the graph on which the decoding problem is defined.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the graph is constructed by first taking the circuit encoding logical `0`, for which all bit values in the output string should be `0`. Many copies of this and then created and run on a simulator, with a different single Pauli operator inserted into each. This is done for each of the three types of Pauli operators on each of the qubits and at every circuit depth. The output from each of these circuits can be used to determine the effects of each possible single error. Since the circuit contains only Clifford operations, the simulation can be performed efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, the error will change exactly two of the characters (unless it has no effect). A graph is then constructed for which each bit of the output string corresponds to a node, and the pairs of bits affected by the same error correspond to an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of decoding a particular output string typically requires the algorithm to deduce which set of errors occurred, given the syndrome found in the output string. This can be done by constructing a second graph, containing only nodes that correspond to non-trivial syndrome bits in the output. An edge is then placed between each pair of nodes, with an corresponding weight equal to the length of the minimal path between those nodes in the original graph. A set of errors consistent with the syndrome then corresponds then to finding a perfect matching of this graph. To deduce the most likely set of errors to have occurred, a good tactic would be to find one with the least possible number of errors that is consistent with the observed syndrome. This corresponds to a minimum weight perfect matching of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using minimal weight perfect matching is a standard decoding technique for the repetition code and surface code, and is implemented in `topological_codes`. It can also be used in other cases, such as Color codes, but it does not find the best approximation of the most likely set of errors for every code and noise model. For that reason, other decoding techniques based on the same graph can be used. The `GraphDecoder` of `topological_codes` calculates these graphs for a given code, and will provide a range of methods to analyze it. At time of writing, only minimum weight perfect matching is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, for codes such as the surface code, it is not strictly true than each single error will change the value of only two bits in the output string. A $\\sigma^y$ error, for example would flip a pair of values corresponding to two different types of stabilizer, which are typically decoded independently. Output for these codes will therefore be presented in a way that acknowledges this, and analysis of such syndromes will correspondingly create multiple independent graphs to represent the different syndrome types."

    "\n",
    "We will now run examples of repetition codes on real devices, and use the results as a benchmark. First, we will briefly summarize the process. This applies to this example of the repetition code, but also for other benchmarking procedures in `topological_codes`, and indeed for `topological_codes` in general. In each case, the following three-step process is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A task is defined. `topological_codes` determines the set of circuits that must be run and creates them.\n",
    "2. The circuits are run. This is typically done using Qiskit. However, in principle any service or experimental equipment could be interfaced.\n",
    "3. `topological_codes` is used to process the results from the circuits, to create the output required for the given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `topological_codes`, step 1 requires the type and size of quantum error correction code to be chosen. Each type of code has a dedicated Python class. A corresponding object is initialized by providing the parameters required, such as `n` and `T` for a `RepetitionCode` object. The resulting object then contains the circuits corresponding to the given code encoding simple logical qubit states (such as $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$), and then running the procedure of error detection for a specified number of rounds, before final readout in a straightforward logical basis (typically a standard $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ / $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ measurement).\n",
    "\n",
    "For `topological_codes`, the main processing of step 3 is the decoding, which aims to mitigate for any errors in the final readout by using the information obtained from error detection. The optimal algorithm for decoding typically varies between codes. However, codes with similar structure often make use of similar methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of `topological_codes` is to provide a variety of decoding methods, implemented such that all the decoders can be used on all of the codes. This is done by restricting to codes for which decoding can be described as a graph-theoretic minimization problem. This classic example of such codes are the toric and surface codes. The property is also shared by 2D color codes and matching codes. All of these are prominent examples of so-called topological quantum error correcting codes, which led to the name of the subpackage. However, note that not all topological codes are compatible with such a decoder. Also, some non-topological codes will be compatible, such as the repetition code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoding is done by the `GraphDecoder` class. A corresponding object is initialized by providing the code object for which the decoding will be performed. This is then used to determine the graph on which the decoding problem will be defined. The results can then be processed using the various methods of the decoder object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we will see the above ideas put into practice for the repetition code. In doing this we will employ two Boolean variables, `step_2` and `step_3`. The variable `step_2` is used to show which parts of the program need to be run when taking data from a device, and `step_3` is used to show the parts which process the resulting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are set to false by default, to ensure that all the program snippets below can be run using only previously collected and processed data. However, to obtain new data one only needs to use `step_2 = True`, and perform decoding on any data one only needs to use `step_3 = True`."

    "When running a circuit on a real device, a transpilation process is first implemented. This changes the gates of the circuit into the native gate set implement by the device. In some cases these changes are fairly trivial, such as expressing each Hadamard as a single qubit rotation by the corresponding Euler angles. However, the changes can be more major if the circuit does not respect the connectivity of the device. For example, suppose the circuit requires a controlled-NOT that is not directly implemented by the device. The effect must be then be reproduced with techniques such as using additional controlled-NOT gates to move the qubit states around. As well as introducing additional noise, this also delocalizes any noise already present. A single qubit error in the original circuit could become a multiqubit monstrosity under the action of the additional transpilation. Such non-trivial transpilation must therefore be prevented when running quantum error correction circuits.\n",

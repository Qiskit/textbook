    "# Phase kickback\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase kickback is a quantum-mechancial effect in which a controlled operation affects the relative phase of the controlling qubit. This effect is uniquely quantum; it only appears when quantum states are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase kickback is a core component of many algorithms, including Deutsch's algorithm, Shor's algorithm, and the HHL algorithm. It's also a simple demonstration of quantum decoherence and the quantum observer effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a unitary gate, $U$, acting on a register in one of its eigenstates, $|u\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U |u\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i \\theta}|u\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/general-kickback-1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we control this operation on the state of another qubit, when this control qubit is $|0\\rangle$, nothing will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ CU |0\\rangle|u\\rangle = |0\\rangle|u\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/general-kickback-2.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the control qubit is $|1\\rangle$, we introduce a global phase of $e^{2\\pi i \\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "CU |1\\rangle|u\\rangle &= |1\\rangle\\otimes U|u\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "                      &= |1\\rangle\\otimes e^{2\\pi i \\theta}|u\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "                      &= e^{2\\pi i \\theta} |1\\rangle |u\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/general-kickback-3.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the control qubit is in a superposition of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, then we see the phase kickback effect.\n",

    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Controlled-X gate\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the unitary operation is an $X$ gate, and the target register is a qubit in the state $|{-}\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the fact that $X|{-}\\rangle = -|{-}\\rangle$, we can work out the state of the control and target qubits after applying the controlled-X gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "CX |{+}\\rangle|{-}\\rangle &= \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} CU|0\\rangle|{-}\\rangle + \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} CU |1\\rangle|{-}\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0\\rangle|{-}\\rangle - \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1\\rangle |{-}\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle) |{-}\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= |{-}\\rangle |{-}\\rangle\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the control of the CX-gate is acting like a $Z$ gate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the relationships $H|0\\rangle = |{+}\\rangle$, $H|1\\rangle = |{-}\\rangle$ (and the reverse), we can come to the following identity.\n",

    "Let's start with the two branches that lead to the state $|0\\rangle$. For the top branch, we do $\\sqrt{1/2}\\times\\sqrt{1/2} = 1/2$, and we add that to the other branch that leads to $|0\\rangle$ (for which we also get the $1/2$). Adding these together, the final magnitude of the amplitude of the state $|0\\rangle$ is $\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2} = 1$. This means the probability of measuring $|0\\rangle$ is also $1$.\n",

Both these branches also end up with magnitudes of $1/2$, but the branch on the bottom is pointing the other way. This means these two amplitudes cancel out! On the amplitude tree, we've used a minus sign to show that the H-gate has reversed the direction of this amplitude. The final amplitude of the state $|1\\rangle$ is then $0$, which matches what we thought would happen!\n",

This leads people to say things like “the qubit can be $0$ _and_ $1$ _at the same time!”_, which isn’t necessarily an incorrect way to describe the behaviour of the qubit, but also isn’t especially useful to people learning about quantum computing. It’s important to remember that, because we don’t see behaviour like this in our everyday lives, we don’t really have common words for it, which is why scientists created the new words we’ll learn about in this course.\n",

    "We now have a working explanation of the H-gate using amplitude trees, but using trees can get messy quite quickly. There are so many branches and labels that even trees for a small number of qubits get very complicated. To simplify this, quantum computer scientists use mathematical objects called ‘[vectors](gloss:vector)’ which, for our purposes, are just lists of numbers. At each point in our computation, we can use a vector to keep track of the amplitudes of all the possible outcomes. \n",

    "The number of possible outcomes doubles with each extra qubit we add, and if we use this technique, the size of our vectors will grow exponentially too. This isn’t true for every quantum circuit, for example, if we start with all our qubits in the state 0 and do nothing to them, then it’s pretty easy to predict what the output will be. But it seems to be that more difficult quantum circuits can only be simulated on classical computers through algorithms that grow exponentially with the number of qubits in the circuit. The upper limit for simulating a difficult quantum circuit tends to be somewhere between the 30-40 qubit mark.\n",

    "- We can make bits out of objects that follow the rules of quantum mechanics, and we call these “qubits” \n",
    "- These qubits can be described using probability amplitudes, which are like classical probabilities but with   “phase”\n",
    "- These amplitudes can cancel each other out (an effect called interference) and this is what causes the previously unexplained behaviour\n",
    "- The best algorithms we have for simulating qubits use exponential resources with the number of qubits, so simulating large numbers of qubits is out of reach for classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that quantum computers can do something classical computers can’t: simulating the behaviour of qubits! The classical computer needs exponential resources, but the quantum computer can just carry out the operations and see what happens. The next interesting question is: “Can a quantum computer solve any other problems that a classical computer can’t?”. In this course we’ll see the answer is “yes”!\n",

    "## The power of entanglement\n",
    "\n",
    "Entanglement is a key ingredient of many aspects of quantum computing. It powers the algorithms and methods that we use, and it is a necessary part of any quantum advantage. To get some idea of why this is, we'll take a few specific examples of entanglement in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entangled states and simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully describe the state of $n$ qubits, we may need to keep track of up to $2^n$ amplitudes. Since these vectors grow exponentially with the number of qubits, quantum computers with large numbers of qubits become very difficult to simulate. A modern laptop can easily handle $2^{20}$ amplitudes (the maximum needed for 20 qubits), but processing $2^{100}$ amplitudes (the maximum needed for 100 qubits) is too difficult for even the largest supercomputers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes there’s a smarter way. For example, suppose we begin in a product state. This means that each qubit can be independently described by a single qubit state with two amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose we perform a circuit with only single qubit gates. These manipulations can be easily described by modifying the single qubit states, which means making changes to the specific pairs of amplitudes affected. Then, when each qubit is measured, the probability of the outcome `0` or `1` for each qubit are determined by their respective amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this process, the states remained product states. As such there was never truly an $n$-qubit computation, but rather $n$ separate single qubit computations. This makes it possible to keep track of everything with a very manageable $2 n$ amplitudes, rather than the full $2^n$. For such situations, simulating thousands of qubits would be easy even for your phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful quantum algorithms need to be able to do things that classical computers cannot simulate, so they must work in a way that prevents tricks like this from being found. They must involve more complex manipulations of the qubits, creating states for which there are no easy shortcuts. This means that they must use states for which the full $2^n$ amplitude description is needed, and so will need to involve more than just product states. And since anything that is not a product state is an entangled state, we find that entanglement is a necessary ingredient of any quantum advantage."

But it also incorporates the idea of qubits being transmitted between different parties, and explores applications based on sending information rather than processing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classical communication there is a fundamental limit on how much information we can send with a given number of bits. By definition, we can send no more than $n$ bits of information when we send $n$ bits. For quantum information, much the same rule applies: no more than $n$ bits of information can be reliably encoded and retrieved from $n$ qubits. However, there are ways that we can push the boundaries to do things that are not possible classically, and for that we require entanglement.

    "For example, the state $|\\Phi^+ \\rangle$ is a superposition of $|00\\rangle$ and $|11\\rangle$, whereas $|\\Psi^+ \\rangle$ is a superposition of $|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$. So a simple `x` gate on either qubit is sufficient to rotate a $|\\Phi^+ \\rangle$ into $|\\Psi^+ \\rangle$ and vice-versa. The same is true for rotating between $|\\Phi^- \\rangle$ into $|\\Psi^- \\rangle$. Similarly the difference between $|\\Phi^+ \\rangle$ and $|\\Phi^- \\rangle$ is simply the relative phase, which can be changed by a `z` on either qubit, and the same with $|\\Psi^+ \\rangle$ and $|\\Psi^- \\rangle$. So Alice could send her message by creating an entangled state first, and then changing it using `x` and `z` gates to encode the correct message."

    "Now let's consider another situation with our friends Alice, Bob, and Charlie. First, we'll consider a completely classical case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose Charlie packages up a pair of colored shapes every day, sending one out to Alice and the other to Bob. Every day, Alice & Bob look at their shape and compare what they have received. For each shape they look at one of two properties: whether it was a cube or not, and whether it was blue or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "After many days, and many choices of whether to look at the shape or color, they make two observations\n",

    "2. If one is not blue, the other will be a cube.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly Charlie is not just sending out random shapes. There is some degree of correlation between the objects that Charlie chooses to send.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these observations in mind, Alice and Bob imagine the case that they both look at the color, and they both find that their shape is not blue. Bob would then be able to apply observation 2 and infer that Alice's shape is certainly a cube. Alice could do the same and infer that Bob's shape is a cube. However, from observation 1 they know that this is impossible. So they conclude that one of their shapes will always be blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a rather artificial scenario, but it shows that there are limits on the kind of correlations possible with classical systems (like colored shapes). The color and shape of each object are both simultaneously well-defined. This means we can apply chains of logic such as those above, which use the results of one to deduce things about the other.\n",

    "\n",
    "The only information we extract from a qubit is through measurement: We apply the measure operation and get back a `0` or a `1`. The way that this is physically implemented in a quantum computer depends on the details of how your qubit is built. For some types of qubit, it's possible to rotate the measurement device to do different kinds of measurement, and see different behavior from the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other kinds of qubit, rotating your measurement device will just break it. Nevertheless, there is a simple way to get the same effect: just rotate the qubit instead! By performing single qubit gates before making a standard measurement, we reproduce the effects of these alternative forms of measurement.\n",

    "### The uncertainty principle\n",
    "\n",
    "All these results are the consequence of the uncertainty principle discovered by Werner Heisenberg, which is one of the most important aspects of quantum mechanics. It states that for certain pairs of attributes of a quantum system, it is impossible to know both with certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not true of the color and shape of an object, as in our example before. As we know from everyday experience, knowing exactly what shape something is does not cause its color to become random.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true, however, for the outcomes of z and x measurements. These are two different ways that we could choose to encode a bit of information in a qubit. We can do it the normal way, using the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states to encode the bit values `0` and `1` and using the z measurement to read it out. Or we could do it an alternative way, using the $|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$ states to encode the bit values and the x measurement for read out. But the uncertainty principle makes sure that we can't do both at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, for the z measurements we can define a quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\class{expectation-value-Z}{\\langle Z \\rangle} = \\class{pz0}{p_z(0)} - \\class{pz1}{p_z(1)},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_z(0)$ is the probability of the outcome `0`, and $p_z(1)$ is the probability of `1`. This quantity reaches its maximum value of $1$ for a state that is certain to output `0`, and its minimum value of $-1$ for a state certain to output `1`. Note that in both of these cases where the output is certain, $\\langle Z \\rangle^2 = 1$. For a completely random result, however, we would find $\\langle Z \\rangle = \\langle Z \\rangle^2 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can similarly define the quantity $\\class{_expectation-value-X}{\\langle X \\rangle}$ for the outcomes of x measurements. For these we can find that, for any valid state vector\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle Z \\rangle^2 + \\langle X \\rangle^2 \\leq 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the uncertainty principle for a qubit, specifically how much certainty can be shared between these kinds of measurement."

    "## Unique quantum correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "With the notions of these different measurement bases, we can start to look at unique correlations that are possible for qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's again consider our friends Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Charlie creates a particular entangled state and sends one qubit to Alice and the other to Bob. They make measurements and compare the results. Then Charlie sends another, identically prepared state. This repeats many times, so Alice and Bob can build up statistics on all the different measurement results.\n",

    "These correspond exactly to the observations made for the colored shapes in the classical scenario. If we apply the same logic as we did in that case, we can analyse the case where both Alice and Bob make an x measurement, and they both get the result `1`. Bob would then be able to apply observation 2 and infer that Alice would certainly have gotten a `0` if she had instead done a z measurement. Alice can do the same, inferring that Bob would have gotten a `1` if he'd have made a z measurement. So together they conclude that, if they had both made z measurements, they would both have gotten the output `0`. Since observation 1 shows us that such a result would be impossible, Alice and Bob could predict that the `11` result will never occur.\n",

It also means that restrictions applied to classical variables do not always apply to qubits, and that quantum correlations can have properties that would be impossible classically. These unique correlations are one of the signature properties of entangled states."

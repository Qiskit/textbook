    "# Describing quantum computers\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will introduce the different mathematical objects and notations that we’re going to be using to describe quantum computers. Symbols, equations and specialist vocabulary allow us to communicate and work with maths in a very concise way, they’re incredibly powerful tools, but they also come at a cost; they are difficult to understand if you don’t know what all the symbols mean, and this can alienate people. To counter this, in this textbook, equations are interactive. You can move your mouse over symbols to see what they mean. We will also slowly sprinkle in some [esoteric](gloss:esoteric) words so you can start speaking the language of mathematics and quantum computing, and you can see explanations of these words by moving your mouse over these words too.\n",

    "## Amplitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "A classical probability is often represented by a [real number](gloss:real-number) between 0 and 1, but amplitudes also have a direction. A natural candidate to represent an amplitude is a [complex number](gloss:complex-number), as a complex number can also be completely described by both a magnitude and a direction, but in this course we will only work with amplitudes that can point in two directions (e.g. left and right) and we won’t worry about anything else.\n",

    "This makes the maths a lot simpler, as we can now describe any amplitude as a number between -1 and +1; if the number is positive, the amplitude is facing forward, and if it's negative, it's facing backwards. It turns out that this is still enough to do interesting things!\n",

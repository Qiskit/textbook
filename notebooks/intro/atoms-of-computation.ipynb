    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming a quantum computer is now something that anyone can do in the comfort of their own home. But what to create? What is a quantum program anyway? In fact, what is a quantum computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions can be answered by making comparisons to traditional digital computers. Unfortunately, most people don’t actually understand how traditional digital computers work either. On this page, we’ll look at the basic principles behind these traditional devices. To help us transition over to quantum computing later, we’ll do it using the same tools we'll use with quantum computers.\n",

    "## Splitting information into bits \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to know about is the idea of _bits_. These are designed to be the world’s simplest alphabet. With only two symbols, 0 and 1, we can represent any piece of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example is numbers. You are probably used to representing a number through a [string](gloss:string) of the ten digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. In this string of digits, each digit represents how many times the number contains a certain [power](gloss:power) of ten. For example, when we write 213, we mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 200+10+3 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or, expressed in a way that emphasizes the powers of ten\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (2×10^2)+(1×10^1)+(3×10^0) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we usually use this system based on the number 10, we can just as easily use one based on any other number. The binary number system, for example, is based on the number two. This means using the two characters 0 and 1 to express numbers as multiples of powers of two. For example, 213 becomes 11010101, since:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "213 = & \\phantom{+}(1×2^7)+(1×2^6)+(0×2^5)\\\\\n",
    "       & +(1×2^4)+(0×2^3)+(1×2^2)\\\\\n",
    "       & +(0×2^1)+(1×2^0) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this we are expressing numbers as multiples of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. instead of 10, 100, 1000, etc.\n",

    "These strings of bits, known as binary strings, can be used to represent more than just numbers. For example, there is a way to represent any text using bits. For any letter, number, or punctuation mark you want to use, you can find a corresponding string of at most eight bits using [this table](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=adapters-ascii-decimal-hexadecimal-octal-binary-conversion-table). Though these are quite arbitrary, this is a widely agreed-upon standard. In fact, it's what was used to transmit this article to you through the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how all information is represented in conventional computers. Whether numbers, letters, images, or sound, it all exists in the form of binary strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like our standard digital computers, quantum computers are based on this same basic idea. The main difference is that they use _qubits,_ an extension of the bit to [quantum mechanics](gloss:quantum-mechanics). In the rest of this textbook, we will explore what qubits are, what they can do, and how they do it. In this section, however, we are not talking about quantum at all.

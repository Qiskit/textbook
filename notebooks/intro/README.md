# Introduction course

These notebooks are the source files for the _Introduction_ course of the Qiskit Textbook.

## Overview

This short course contains around 3 hours of content and is aimed at
self-learners from all backgrounds (technical and non-technical). The aim of
this course is to give a solid understanding of the principles behind quantum
computing, focusing on developing intuition. After this course, you will have a
fair understanding of quantum computing and Qiskit, as well as a short project
demonstrating it. You should then be able to jump straight into many of the
other courses in this textbook when they are ready, including traditional
algorithms and protocols, near term quantum algorithms, and quantum machine
learning.

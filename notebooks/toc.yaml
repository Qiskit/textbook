        your journey into quantum computing, or just curious as to what it's
        all about, this course will take you from zero to one, without the hand
        waving.
      long: |
        This short course contains around 3 hours of content and is aimed at
        self-learners from all backgrounds (technical and non-technical). The
        aim of this course is to give a solid understanding of the principles
        behind quantum computing, focussing on developing intuition. After this
        course, you will have a fair understanding of quantum computing and
        Qiskit, as well as a short project demonstrating it. You should then be
        able to jump straight into many of the other courses in this textbook
        when they are ready, including traditional algorithms and protocols,

        Want to learn about this exciting, developing field? If you're familiar
        with quantum computing basics, this course will give you a primer on
        machine learning, walk you through key concepts, and bring you up to
        speed with recent developments.
      long: |
        This course contains around eight hours of content, and is aimed at
        self-learners who are comfortable with undergraduate-level mathematics
        and quantum computing fundamentals. This course will take you through
        key concepts in quantum machine learning, such as parameterized quantum
        circuits, training these circuits, and applying them to basic problems.
        By the end of the course, you'll understand the state of the field, and
        you'll be familiar with recent developments in both supervised and
        unsupervised learning such as quantum kernels and general adversarial
        networks. This course finishes with a project that you can use to
        showcase what you've learnt.

        This course was created by IBM Quantum with the help of Qiskit Advocates
        through the Qiskit Advocate Mentoring Program.

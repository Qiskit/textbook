        Want to learn about this exciting, developing field? If you're familiar
        with quantum computing basics, this course will give you a primer on
        machine learning, walk you through key concepts, and bring you up to
        speed with recent developments.
      long: |
        This course contains around eight hours of content, and is aimed at
        self-learners who are comfortable with undergraduate-level mathematics
        and quantum computing fundamentals. This course will take you through
        key concepts in quantum machine learning, such as parameterized quantum
        circuits, training these circuits, and applying them to basic problems.
        By the end of the course, you'll understand the state of the field, and
        you'll be familiar with recent developments in both supervised and
        unsupervised learning such as quantum kernels and general adversarial
        networks. This course finishes with a project that you can use to
        showcase what you've learnt.

        This course was created by IBM Quantum with the help of Qiskit Advocates
        through the Qiskit Advocate Mentoring Program.

      long: |
        If you think quantum mechanics sounds challenging, you’re not alone.
        Our intuitions come from day-to-day experiences, and so are better at
        understanding the behavior of balls and bananas than atoms or
        electrons. Though quantum objects can seem random and chaotic at first,
        they just follow a different set of rules. Once we know what those
        rules are, we can use them to create new and powerful technology.
        Quantum computing will be the most revolutionary example of this.

      short: |
        In this chapter, we use quantum effects to build powerful algorithms,
        starting from simple proof-of-concept algorithms, through to Shor's
        famous factoring algorithm (and beyond).
      long: |
        So far, we've seen various quantum gates and operations, and we've
        explored some interesting properties of these gates. Each of these
        pages shows how we can combine quantum operations into a quantum
        algorithm that outperforms their classical counterpart. As a bonus,
        some of these algorithms are actually useful too!

        Qiskit, and the Qiskit Textbook website, are interactive learning
        environments. Unlike with traditional, ink-and-paper textbooks, you can
        mess around with quantum effects to strengthen your knowledge. These
        pages contain cool experiments with Qiskit that don't belong in a
        course.
    prerequisites:
      - title: Setting Up Your Environment
        description: |
          This is a comprehensive guide for setting up your environment on your
          personal computer for working with Qiskit Textbook.

      - title: Python and Jupyter Notebooks
        description: |
          Python is a programming language where you don't need to compile. You
          can just run it line by line...

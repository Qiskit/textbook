        This is the second unit of the "Understanding quantum information and
        computation" series, which explains quantum information and computation at a
        detailed mathematical level.
        This unit, "Fundamentals of quantum algorithms", explores computational
        advantages of quantum information, including what we can do with quantum
        computers and their advantages over classical computers. The unit begins
        with quantum query algorithms, which offer simple proof of concept
        demonstrations for quantum algorithms, and then moves on to quantum
        algorithms for problems including integer factorization and searching, which
        are more representative of the types of computational problems that might be
        encountered in real-world scenarios.

        This course contains around eight hours of content, and is aimed at
        self-learners who are comfortable with undergraduate-level mathematics
        and quantum computing fundamentals. This course will take you through
        key concepts in quantum machine learning, such as parameterized quantum
        circuits, training these circuits, and applying them to basic problems.
        By the end of the course, you'll understand the state of the field, and
        you'll be familiar with recent developments in both supervised and
        unsupervised learning such as quantum kernels and general adversarial
        networks. This course finishes with a project that you can use to
        showcase what you've learnt.

        This course was created by IBM Quantum with the help of Qiskit Advocates
        through the Qiskit Advocate Mentoring Program.

        If you think quantum mechanics sounds challenging, you’re not alone.
        Our intuitions come from day-to-day experiences, and so are better at
        understanding the behavior of balls and bananas than atoms or
        electrons. Though quantum objects can seem random and chaotic at first,
        they just follow a different set of rules. Once we know what those
        rules are, we can use them to create new and powerful technology.
        Quantum computing will be the most revolutionary example of this.

        some of these algorithms are actually useful too!

        Check out games and demonstrations created in this textbook's
        environment; great for teaching, or just for fun!
      long: |
        Qiskit, and the Qiskit Textbook website, are interactive learning
        environments. Unlike with traditional, ink-and-paper textbooks, you can
        mess around with quantum effects to strengthen your knowledge. These
        pages contain cool experiments with Qiskit that don't belong in a
        course.
    prerequisites:
      - title: Setting Up Your Environment
        description: |
          This is a comprehensive guide for setting up your environment on your
          personal computer for working with Qiskit Textbook.

      - title: Python and Jupyter Notebooks
        description: |
          Python is a programming language where you don't need to compile. You
          can just run it line by line...

## Overview

This course contains around eight hours of content, and is aimed at
self-learners who are comfortable with undergraduate-level mathematics and
quantum computing fundamentals. This course will take you through key concepts
in quantum machine learning, such as parameterized quantum circuits, training
these circuits, and applying them to basic problems. By the end of the course,
you'll understand the state of the field, and you'll be familiar with recent
developments in both supervised and unsupervised learning such as quantum
kernels and general adversarial networks. This course finishes with a project
that you can use to showcase what you've learnt.

This course was created by IBM Quantum with the help of Qiskit Advocates
through the Qiskit Advocate Mentoring Program.

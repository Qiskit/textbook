    "Hopefully you enjoyed learning about quantum computing. If so, we now encourage you to try a project. In your project, you'll pick an area you’ve come across that you find interesting and investigate it. The final form of your project can be whatever you choose, from a blog post explaining an investigation, to improving Qiskit itself.\n",

    "If you haven’t joined already, the Qiskit [Slack](gloss:slack) workspace is a great place to ask questions and get support. The developers of Qiskit and this online textbook hang out there, as well as plenty of students and enthusiasts. You can join via [this link](https://qisk.it/join-slack), and introduce yourself in the [`#textbook-projects`](https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/C028AGU6KDX) channel.\n",

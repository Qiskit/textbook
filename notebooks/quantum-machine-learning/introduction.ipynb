Throwing in quantum computing gives rise to interesting areas of research that aim to use the principles of quantum mechanics to augment machine learning, or vice-versa. On this page, we aim to give you a glimpse into the exciting and rapidly changing field of near-term quantum machine learning."

Maybe the existence of quantum hardware might enable further advances in the field.\n",

## Overview

If you think quantum mechanics sounds challenging, youâ€™re not alone. Our
intuitions come from day-to-day experiences, and so are better at understanding
the behavior of balls and bananas than atoms or electrons. Though quantum
objects can seem random and chaotic at first, they just follow a different set
of rules. Once we know what those rules are, we can use them to create new and
powerful technology. Quantum computing will be the most revolutionary example
of this.

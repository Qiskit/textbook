However, they can also be manipulated in ways that can only be described by quantum mechanics. This gives us new gates to play with, allowing us to find new ways to design algorithms.\n",

As such, they would be no different from classical bits and our computation could be easily replaced by a classical computation. To achieve truly quantum computation we must allow the qubits to explore more complex states. Measurements are therefore only used when we need to extract an output. This means that we often place all the measurements at the end of our quantum circuit. \n",

The Bloch vector is a visualisation tool that maps the 2D, complex statevector onto real, 3D space."

    "If you think quantum mechanics sounds challenging, you are not alone. All of our intuitions are based on day-to-day experiences, and so are better at understanding the behavior of balls and bananas than atoms or electrons. Though quantum objects can seem random and chaotic at first, they just follow a different set of rules. Once we know what those rules are, we can use them to create new and powerful technology. Quantum computing will be the most revolutionary example of this."

    "Actually, they are all correct: it's a very multi-purpose word! But if you chose \"the smallest unit of information\", it shows that you are already thinking along the right lines. The idea that information can be stored and processed as a series of ```0```s and ```1```s is quite a big conceptual hurdle, but it's something most people today know without even thinking about it. Taking this as a starting point, we can start to imagine bits that obey the rules of quantum mechanics. These [quantum bits](gloss:qubit), or *qubits*, will then allow us to process information in new and different ways.\n",

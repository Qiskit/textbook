## Overview

These pages are hands-on exercises that interact with IBM Quantum's real
quantum systems. Aimed at late-undergraduate / early-graduate courses, these
lab modules start cover basic quantum circuits, to exploring core algorithms
such as Grover search and Shor's algorithm. These pages tackle the limitations
of today's quantum computers, and ways to account for them.

    "Determine the Bloch components of a qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental to the operation of a quantum computer is the ability to compute the Bloch components of a qubit or qubits.  These components correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli operators $X, Y, Z$, and are important quantities for applications such as quantum chemistry and optimization.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to simultaneously compute these values, thus requiring many executions of the same circuit.  In addition, measurements are restricted to the computational basis (Z-basis) so that each Pauli needs to be rotated to the standard basis to access the x and y components.  Here we verify the methods by considering the case of a random vector on the Bloch sphere."

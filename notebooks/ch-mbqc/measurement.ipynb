If you recall the teleportation chapter from the Qiskit textbook, you will notice that at the end of the protocol, we corrected the teleportation by applying X and Z gates selectively depending on previous measurement outcomes. MBQC also works by relying on the same teleportation concept. It is strongly suggested to check out the teleportation tutorial if you haven't yet!\n",

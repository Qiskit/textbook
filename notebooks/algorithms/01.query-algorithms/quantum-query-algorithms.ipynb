    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This course investigates *computational* advantages offered by quantum information.\n",
    "That is, we will think about what we can do with *quantum computers*, and the advantages they can offer over ordinary classical computers.\n",
    "To be specific, our focus will be on what we can do with a *single* quantum computer — as opposed to a distributed setting where multiple quantum computers interact over a network, for instance.\n",
    "(There are, in fact, quantum advantages to be found in distributed settings, where communication and cryptography come into play, but this topic is outside of the scope of this unit.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with a natural question: What are the advantages that a quantum computer might potentially offer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first potential advantage, which is paramount among all others, is that quantum computers might provide *faster* solutions to some computational problems.\n",
    "Time is a truly precious resource — and it is this potential, that quantum computers may allow us to solve certain computational problems that classical computers are too slow to solve, that has driven quantum computing research for the past few decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other computational resources besides time that can be considered.\n",
    "The amount *computer memory* required to perform computations — usually referred to as the *space* required for computations — is one alternative that is often studied.\n",
    "As it turns out, however, quantum computers have a limited potential to offer advantages in space usage over classical computers.\n",
    "Computer memory is also relatively inexpensive and, unlike time, can be reused.\n",
    "For these reasons, time is of greater concern, and will be our primary focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that quantum computers cannot do is to provide computational solutions to problems that classical computers cannot solve — irrespective of the resources required — such as the famous *halting problem* formulated by Alan Turing in the 1930s.\n",
    "Quantum computers can be *simulated* by classical computers, so any computational problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, though it might take the classical computer much, much longer to find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the time required to solve problems is our main concern, we will deviate slightly from this focus for the purposes of this first lesson.\n",
    "What we will do is to formulate a simple algorithmic framework — known as the *query model* — and explore the advantages that quantum computers offer within this framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query model of computation is like a petri dish for quantum algorithmic ideas.\n",
    "It is rigid and unnatural, in the sense that it does not accurately represent the sorts of computational problems we generally care about in practice.\n",
    "Nevertheless, it has proved to be incredibly useful as a tool for developing quantum algorithmic techniques, including ones that power the most well-known quantum algorithms (such as Shor's factoring algorithm).\n",
    "It also happens to be a very useful framework for *explaining* these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "After introducing the query model, we will discuss the very first quantum algorithm discovered, which is *Deutsch's algorithm*, along with an extension of Deutsch's algorithm known as the *Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm*.\n",
    "These algorithms demonstrate quantifiable advantages of quantum over classical computers, and in fact the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can be used to solve multiple computational problems in the query model framework.\n",
    "We will then discuss a related quantum algorithm — known as *Simon's algorithm* — which, for reasons that will be explained, offers a more robust and satisfying advantage of quantum over classical computations."

    "\n",
    "It is true that the computers we use today continuously receive input and produce output, essentially interacting with both us and with other computers in a way not reflected by the figure.\n",
    "Here, however, the intention is not to represent the ongoing operation of computers, but rather to create a simple abstraction of computation, focusing on isolated computational tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the input might encode a number, a vector, a matrix, a graph, a description of a molecule, or something more complicated, while the output encodes a solution to the computational task we have in mind.\n",
    "The key point is that the input is provided to the computation, usually in the form of a binary string, with no part of it being hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-level description\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *query model* of computation, on the other hand, the entire input is not provided to the computation.\n",
    "Rather, the input is made available in the form of a *function*, which the computation accesses by making *queries*.\n",

    "It is as if we're consulting the Oracle at Delphi about the input: she won't tell us everything she knows, she only answers specific questions.\n",
    "The term *black box* makes sense especially when we think about the input as being represented by a function: we cannot look inside the function and understand how it works, we can only evaluate it on arguments we select.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be working exclusively with binary strings throughout the lesson, so let's write $\\Sigma = \\{0,1\\}$ to refer to the binary alphabet throughout for the sake of brevity.\n",

    "\n",
    "To say that a computation makes a *query* means that some string $x \\in \\Sigma^n$ is selected and then the string $f(x)\\in\\Sigma^m$ is made available.\n",
    "The precise way that this works for quantum algorithms will be discussed shortly — we need to make sure that this is possible to do with a unitary quantum operation allowing queries to be made in superposition — but for now we can think about it intuitively at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the way that we will measure efficiency of query algorithms is simple: we'll count the number of queries to the input they require.\n",
    "This is related to the time required to perform a computation, but it's not exactly the same because we're ignoring the time required for operations other than the queries, and we're treating the queries as if they each have unit cost.\n",
    "(We can also take the operations besides the queries into account, and that is sometimes done — but restricting our attention just to the number of queries helps to keep things simple.)"

    "### Examples of query problems\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **OR.** The input function takes the form $f:\\Sigma^n \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ (so $m=1$ for this problem). The task is to output $1$ if there exists a string $x\\in\\Sigma^n$ for which $f(x) = 1$, and to output $0$ if there is no such string. If we think about the function $f$ as representing a sequence of $2^n$ bits to which we have random access, the problem is to compute the OR of these bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parity.** The input function again takes the form $f:\\Sigma^n \\rightarrow \\Sigma.$ The task is to determine whether the number of strings $x\\in\\Sigma^n$ for which $f(x) = 1$ is *even* or *odd*. \n",
    "To be precise, the required output is $0$ if the set $\\{x\\in\\Sigma^n : f(x) = 1\\}$ has an even number of elements and $1$ if it has an odd number of elements. If we think about the function $f$ as representing a sequence of $2^n$ bits to which we have random access, the problem is to compute the parity (or XOR) of these bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimum.** The input function takes the form $f:\\Sigma^n \\rightarrow \\Sigma^m$ for any choices of positive integers $n$ and $m.$ The required output is the string $y \\in \\{f(x) : x\\in\\Sigma^n\\}$ that comes first in the lexicographic (i.e., dictionary) ordering of $\\Sigma^m.$\n",
    "If we think about the function $f$ as representing a sequence of $2^n$ integers encoded as strings of length $m$ in binary notation to which we have random access, the problem is to compute the minimum of these integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we also consider query problems where we have a *promise* on the input.\n",
    "What this means is that we're given some sort of guarantee on the input, and we're not responsible for what happens when this guarantee is not met.\n",
    "Another way to describe this type of problem is that some input functions (the ones for which the promise is not satisfied) are considered as \"don't care\" inputs.\n",
    "No requirements at all are placed on algorithms when they're given \"don't care\" inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's one example of a problem with a promise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unique search.** The input function takes the form $f:\\Sigma^n \\rightarrow \\Sigma$, and we are *promised* that there is exactly one string $z\\in\\Sigma^n$ for which $f(z) = 1$, with $f(x) = 0$ for all strings $x\\neq z.$ The task is to find this unique string $z.$\n",
    "\n",
    "All four of the examples just described are natural in the sense that they're easy to describe and we can imagine a variety of situations or contexts in which they might arise — but some query problems of interest aren't like this at all.\n",
    "In the study of the query model we sometimes come up with very complicated and highly contrived problems where it's difficult to imagine that anyone would ever actually want to solve them in practice.\n",
    "This doesn't mean the problems aren't interesting, it's just part of the study of the model to look for extremes that reveal potential advantages of quantum computing.\n",
    "Sometimes things that seems contrived or unnatural can provide unexpected clues or inspire new ideas.\n",
    "Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring, which was directly inspired by Simon's algorithm, is a great example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query gates\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're working with circuit models of computation, queries are made by special gates called *query gates*.\n",
    "The simplest way to do this for classical Boolean circuits is to define query gates that compute the input function $f$ directly, as the following figure suggests.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A classical query gate.](images/classical-query-gate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a Boolean circuit for a query problem, the input function $f$ is accessed through these gates, and the number of queries that the circuit makes is simply the number of query gates that appear in the circuit.\n",
    "In this case the wires of the circuit are initialized to fixed values, which should be considered as part of the algorithm rather than as part of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a Boolean circuit with classical query gates that solves the parity problem described above for a function of the form $f:\\Sigma\\rightarrow\\Sigma$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Classical query algorithm for parity.](images/classical-parity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm makes two queries because there are two query gates.\n",
    "The way it works is that the function $f$ is queried on the two possible inputs, $0$ and $1$, and the results are plugged into the Boolean circuit from Lesson 3 that computes the XOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "For quantum circuits, this definition of query gates doesn't work very well because we'll get non-unitary gates for some functions $f$, and we won't be able to apply them to quantum states.\n",
    "What we do instead is to define *unitary query gates* that operate as this figure suggests on standard basis states:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A unitary query gate.](images/unitary-query-gate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here our assumption is that $x\\in\\Sigma^n$ and $y\\in\\Sigma^m$ are arbitrary strings.\n",
    "The notation $y\\oplus f(x)$ refers to the *bitwise exclusive OR* of strings (which have length $m$ in this case).\n",
    "For example, $001 \\oplus 101 = 100.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively speaking, what the gate $U_f$ does (for any chosen function $f$) is to echo the top input string $x$ and XOR the function value $f(x)$ onto the bottom input string $y.$\n",
    "This is a unitary operation for every function $f.$\n",
    "To be more precise, as a matrix $U_f$ is always a *permutation matrix*, meaning a matrix with a single $1$ in each row and each column, with all other entries being $0.$\n",
    "Applying a permutation matrix to a vector simply shuffles the entries of the vector (hence the term *permutation matrix*), and therefore does not change that vector's Euclidean norm — revealing that permutation matrices are always unitary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when we analyze query algorithms by simply counting the number of queries that a query algorithm makes, we're completely ignoring the difficulty of physically constructing the query gates (for both the classical and quantum versions just described).\n",
    "That might seem unreasonable — but we must keep in mind that we're not trying to describe practical computing or fully account for the resources required.\n",
    "Rather, we're just defining a theoretical model that helps to shed light on the potential advantages of quantum computing.\n",
    "We will have more to say about this point in the lesson following this one when we turn our attention to a more standard model of computation where inputs are given explicitly to circuits as binary strings. "

    "\n",
    "#### Classical difficulty\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm works 100% of the time, always giving us the correct answer when the promise is met, and requires a single query.\n",
    "How does this compare with classical query algorithms for the Deutsch-Jozsa problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any *deterministic* classical algorithm for the Deutsch-Jozsa problem must make *lots* of queries — exponentially many, in fact.\n",
    "To be precise, $2^{n-1} + 1$ queries are required in the worst case.\n",
    "This is because if a deterministic algorithm queries $f$ on $2^{n-1}$ different input strings and obtains the same value every time, it still doesn't know for sure if the function is constant or balanced — both answers are still possible depending on the output of $f$ on the strings that weren't queried.\n",
    "So, we have a very significant advantage of quantum over classical algorithms in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a catch, which is that *probabilistic* classical algorithms can solve the Deutsch-Jozsa problem with very high probability using just a few queries.\n",
    "In particular, if we simply choose some inputs to $f$ randomly and evaluate $f$ on those strings, it would be very unlikely for the output values to all be the same when $f$ is balanced.\n",
    "To be specific, if we choose $k$ input strings $x^1,\\ldots,x^k \\in \\Sigma^n$ uniformly at random, evaluate $f(x^1),\\ldots,f(x^k)$ and answer $0$ if they're all the same and $1$ if not, then we'll always be correct when $f$ is constant and wrong in the case that $f$ is balanced with probability just $2^{-k + 1}.$\n",
    "So, if we take $k = 11$, for instance, this algorithm will answer correctly with probability greater than $99.9$%.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for this reason we do still have a rather modest advantage of quantum over classical algorithms — but it is nevertheless a quantifiable advantage that represents an improvement over Deutsch's algorithm."

    "#### Remark on nomenclature\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, it is common that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is referred to as the \"Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm.\"\n",
    "This is slightly misleading, because the algorithm *is* the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, as Bernstein and Vazirani made clear in their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Bernstein and Vazirani did after showing that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm solves the Bernstein-Vazirani problem (as it is stated above) was to define a much more complicated problem, known as the *recursive Fourier sampling problem*.\n",
    "This is a highly contrived problem where solutions to different instances of the problem effectively unlock new levels of the problem arranged in a tree-like structure.\n",
    "The Bernstein-Vazirani problem described earlier is essentially just the base case of this more complicated problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This more complicated problem was the first known example of a query problem where quantum algorithms have a so-called *super-polynomial* advantage over probabilistic algorithms, thereby surpassing the advantage of quantum over classical offered by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum algorithms provide provable advantages over classical algorithms in the query model — but what about more standard models of computation, where problem inputs are given explicitly rather than in the form of an oracle or black box?\n",
    "This turns out to be a much more difficult question to answer, and to address it we must first establish a solid foundation upon which to base our investigation.\n",
    "That's the purpose of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by discussing *computational cost*, for both classical and quantum computations, and how it can be measured.\n",
    "This is a general notion that can be applied to a wide range of computational problems — but to keep things simple we'll mainly examine it through the lens of *computational number theory*, which addresses problems including basic arithmetic, computing greatest common divisors, and integer factorization, which are computational tasks that are likely to be familiar to most readers.\n",
    "While computational number theory is a narrow application domain, these problems serve well to illustrate the basic issues — and as a bonus they happen to be highly relevant to the lesson following this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus will be on *algorithms*, as opposed to the ever-improving hardware on which they're run — so we'll be more concerned with how the cost of running an algorithm scales as the specific problem instances it is run on grow in size, rather than how many seconds, minutes, or hours some particular computation requires.\n",
    "We focus on this aspect of computational cost in recognition of the fact that algorithms have fundamental importance, and will naturally be deployed against larger and larger problem instances using faster and more reliable hardware as technology develops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we turn to a critically important task, which is running *classical* computations on quantum computers.\n",
    "The reason this task is important is not because we hope to replace classical computers with quantum computers (which seems extremely unlikely to happen any time soon, if ever), but rather because it opens up many interesting possibilities for quantum algorithms.\n",
    "Specifically, classical computations running on quantum computers become available as *subroutines* — effectively leveraging decades of research and development on classical algorithms in pursuit of quantum computational advantages."

    "## Two examples: factoring and GCDs\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical computers that exist today are incredibly fast, and their speed seems to be ever increasing.\n",
    "For this reason, some might be inclined to believe that computers are so fast that no computational problem is beyond their reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "This belief is false.\n",
    "Some computational problems are so inherently difficult that, although there exist algorithms to solve them, no computer on the planet Earth today is fast enough to run these algorithms to completion on even moderately sized inputs within the lifetime of a human — or even within the lifetime of the Earth itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- ::: -->\n",
    "\n",
    "By the *prime factorization* of $N$, we mean a list of the prime factors of $N$ and the powers to which they must be raised to obtain $N$ by multiplication.\n",
    "For example, the prime factors of $12$ are $2$ and $3$, and to obtain $12$ we must take the product of $2$ to the power $2$ and $3$ to the power $1:$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to the ordering of the prime factors, there is only one prime factorization for each positive integer $N\\geq 2$, which is a fact known as the *fundamental theorem of arithmetic*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SymPy` symbolic mathematics package for Python includes a function `factorint` that solves the integer factorization problem for whatever input $N$ we choose."

    "### Elementary operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider the computation itself, which is represented by the blue rectangle in the figure above.\n",
    "The way that we'll measure computational cost is to count the number of *elementary operations* that each computation requires.\n",
    "Intuitively speaking, an elementary operation is one involving a small, fixed number of bits or qubits that can be performed quickly and easily — such as computing the AND of two bits.\n",
    "(In contrast, running the `factorint` function is not reasonably viewed as being an elementary operation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally speaking, there are different choices for what constitutes an elementary operation depending on the computational model being used.\n",
    "Our focus will be on circuit models, and specifically quantum and Boolean circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Universal gate sets\n",
    "\n",
    "For circuit-based models of computation, it is typical that each *gate* is viewed as an elementary operation.\n",
    "This leads to the question of precisely which gates we allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing for the moment on quantum circuits, we've seen several gates thus far in the series, including $X$, $Y$, $Z$, $H$, $S$, and $T$ gates, *swap* gates, controlled versions of gates (including *controlled-NOT*, *Toffoli*, and *Fredkin* gates), as well as gates that represent standard basis measurements.\n",
    "In the context of the CHSH game we also saw a few additional *rotation* gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also discussed *query gates* (within the query model), and saw that any unitary operation $U$, acting on any number of qubits, can be viewed as being a gate if we so choose.\n",
    "We'll disregard both of these options for the sake of this discussion.\n",
    "We won't be working in the query model (although the implementation of query gates using elementary operations is discussed later in the lesson), and viewing arbitrary unitary gates, potentially acting on millions of qubits, as being elementary operations does not lead to meaningful or realistic notions of computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sticking with quantum gates that operate on small numbers of qubits, one approach to deciding which ones are to be considered elementary is to tease out a precise criterion — but this is not the standard approach or the one we'll take.\n",
    "Rather, we simply make a choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's one standard choice, which we shall adopt as the *default* gate set for quantum circuits:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Single-qubit unitary gates from this list: $X$, $Y$, $Z$, $H$, $S$, $S^{\\dagger}$, $T$, and $T^{\\dagger}$\n",
    " - Controlled-NOT gates\n",
    " - Single-qubit standard basis measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "A common alternative is to view Toffoli, Hadamard, and $S$ gates as being elementary, in addition to standard basis measurements.\n",
    "(Sometimes all single-qubit gates are viewed as being elementary, although this does lead to an unrealistically powerful model when noise and inaccuracies are not properly accounted for.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The unitary gates in our default collection form what's called a *universal* gate set.\n",
    "This means that we can approximate any unitary operation, on any number of qubits, and to any degree of accuracy we wish, with circuits composed of these gates alone.\n",
    "To be clear, the definition of universality places no requirements on the cost of such approximations, meaning the number of gates from our set that we need.\n",
    "Indeed, a fairly simple argument based on the mathematical notion of *measure* reveals that most unitary operations must have extremely high cost.\n",
    "Proving the universality of quantum gate sets is not a simple matter and won't be covered in this series.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Boolean circuits, we'll take AND, OR, NOT, and FANOUT gates to be the ones representing elementary operations.\n",
    "We don't actually need both AND gates and OR gates — we can use *De Morgan's laws* to convert from either one to the other by placing NOT gates on all three input and output wires — but nevertheless it's both typical and convenient to allow both AND and OR gates.\n",
    "AND, OR, NOT, and FANOUT gates form a universal set for deterministic computations, meaning that any function from any fixed number of input bits to any fixed number of output bits can be implemented with these gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The principle of deferred measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard measurement gates can appear within quantum circuits — but sometimes it's convenient to delay them until the end, so that we can view quantum computations as consisting of a unitary part (representing the computation itself), followed by a simple read-out phase where qubits are measured and the results are output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can always be done, provided that we're willing to add an additional qubit for each standard basis measurement.\n",
    "In the following figure, the circuit on the right illustrates how this can be done for the gate on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Deferring measurements](images/deferred-measurement.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the classical bit in the circuit on the left is replaced by a qubit on the right (initialized to the $\\vert 0\\rangle$ state), and the standard basis measurement is replaced by a controlled-NOT gate, followed by a standard basis measurement on the bottom qubit.\n",
    "The point is that the standard basis measurement in the right-hand circuit can be pushed all the way to the end of the circuit.\n",
    "If the classical bit in the circuit on the left is later used as a control bit, we can use the bottom *qubit* in the circuit on the right as a control instead, and the overall effect will be the same.\n",
    "(We are assuming that the classical bit in the circuit on the left doesn't get overwritten after the measurement takes place by another measurement — but if it did we could always just use a new classical bit rather than overwriting one that was used for a previous measurement.)"

    "### Circuit size and depth\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Circuit size\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of gates in a circuit is referred to as that circuit's *size*.\n",
    "Thus, presuming that the gates in our circuits represent elementary operations, we have that a circuit's size represents the number of elementary operations it requires — or, in other words, its *computational cost*.\n",
    "We write $\\operatorname{size}(C)$ to refer to the size of a given circuit $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following Boolean circuit (from Lesson 3) for computing the XOR of two bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Boolean circuit for XOR](images/Boolean-circuit-XOR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of this circuit is 7, because there are 7 gates in total.\n",
    "(Fanout operations are not always counted as being gates, but for the purposes of this lesson we will count FANOUT operations as being gates.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time, cost, and circuit depth\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson we discussed the importance of *time* as a resource, or limiting constraint, on computations.\n",
    "The examples above, such as the task of factoring RSA1024, reinforce this viewpoint.\n",
    "The `factorint` function doesn't fail to factor RSA1024 per se, it's just that we don't have enough time to let it finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of computational cost, as the number of elementary operations required to perform a computation, is\n",
    "intended to be an abstract proxy for the time required to implement a computation.\n",
    "Each elementary operation requires a certain amount of time to perform, and the more of them a computation needs to perform the longer it's going to take, at least in general.\n",
    "In the interest of simplicity, we'll continue to make this association between computational cost and the time required to run algorithms as we continue on in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "But notice that the size of a circuit doesn't necessarily correspond directly to how long it takes to run.\n",
    "In our Boolean circuit for computing the XOR of two bits, for instance, the two FANOUT gates could be performed simultaneously, as could the two NOT gates, as well as the two AND gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different way to measure efficiency for circuits, which takes this possibility of *parallelization* into account, is by their *depth*.\n",
    "This is the minimum number of *layers* of gates needed within the circuit, where the gates within in each layer operate on different wires.\n",
    "Equivalently, the depth of a circuit is the maximum number of gates encountered on any path from an input wire to an output wire.\n",
    "For the circuit above, for instance, the depth is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit depth is one way to formalize the running time of parallel computations.\n",
    "It's an advanced topic, and there exist very sophisticated circuit constructions known to minimize the depth required for certain computations.\n",
    "There are also some fascinating unanswered questions concerning circuit depth.\n",
    "(For example, much remains unknown about the circuit depth required to compute GCDs.)\n",
    "We won't have too much more to say about circuit depth in this series, aside from including a few interesting facts concerning circuit depth as we go along, but it should be clearly acknowledged that parallelization is a potential source of computational advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assigning costs to different gates\n",
    "\n",
    "One final note concerning circuit size and computational cost is that it is possible to assign different costs to different gates, rather than viewing every gate as contributing equally to cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, as was already mentioned, FANOUT gates are often viewed as being free for Boolean circuits — which is to say that we could choose that FANOUT gates have zero cost.\n",
    "As another example, when we're working in the query model and we count the number of queries that a circuit makes to an input function (in the form of a black box), we're effectively assigning unit cost to query gates and zero cost to other gates, such as Hadamard gates.\n",
    "A final example is that we sometimes weigh the costs of different gates depending on how difficult they are to implement, depending on the particular hardware implementation we have in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "While all of these options are sensible in different contexts, for this lesson we'll keep things simple and stick with circuit size as a representation of computational cost."

    "If we looked at the resulting circuits for different input lengths, we would see that their sizes naturally grow as the input length grows — reflecting the fact that factoring 4-bit integers is much easier and requires far fewer elementary operations than factoring 1024-bit integers, for instance.\n",

    "Starting from the least significant bits, we can compute their XOR to determine the least significant bit for the sum.\n",

    "If we consider a simple *trial division* algorithm that searches through the list $2,\\ldots,\\sqrt{N}$ for prime factors of an input number $N$, then we have $\\sqrt{N}$ iterations — which means $O(2^{n/2})$ iterations when $N$ is an $n$-bit number.\n",
    "Each iteration requires a trial division, which means $O(n^2)$ elementary operations for each iteration (using a standard algorithm for integer division).\n",

    "### Cleaning up the garbage\n",
    "\n",
    "If our only interest is in computing whatever function $f$ is computed by a given Boolean circuit $C$ with a quantum circuit, we don't need to proceed any further than the gate-by-gate simulation just described — and we can accept that in addition to the answer we'll have a bunch of garbage left over.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, however, won't be good enough if we want to perform classical computations as subroutines within larger quantum computations, because those garbage qubits will cause problems.\n",
    "As we saw in the previous lesson, the phenomenon of *interference* is critically important to quantum algorithms, and garbage qubits can ruin the interference patterns needed to make quantum algorithms work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, it's not to difficult to clean up the garbage, so-to-speak.\n",
    "The key is to use the fact that because $R$ is a quantum circuit, we can run it in reverse — by simply replacing each gate with its inverse and applying them in the reverse order — thereby obtaining a quantum circuit for the operation $R^{\\dagger}$.\n",
    "(Toffoli gates, CNOT gates, and NOT gates are their own inverses, so in this case running $R$ in reverse is just a matter of applying the gates in the reverse order — but more generally any quantum circuit can be reversed as just described.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we can do is to add $m$ more qubits (recalling that $m$ is the number of output bits of the function $f$), use CNOT gates to copy the output of $R$ onto these qubits, and then reverse $R$ to clean up the garbage.\n",
    "The following figure illustrates the resulting circuit and describes its action on standard basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Garbage-free computation](images/garbage-free-computation.png)\n",

    "![Simulation as a query gate](images/simulation-as-query-gate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If $C$ has $t$ gates, then $Q$ has $O(t)$ gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we disregard the $k$ additional workspace qubits, what we have is a circuit $Q$ that functions exactly like a query gate for the function $f$.\n",
    "If we simply want to compute the function $f$ on some string $x$, we can set $y = 0^m$ and the resulting value $f(x)$ will appear on the bottom $m$ qubits — or we can feed in a different state to the bottom $m$ qubits if we wish\n",
    "(perhaps to make use of a phase kickback, like in Deutsch's or the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm).\n",
    "This means that for any query algorithm, if we have a Boolean circuit that computes the input function, we can replace each query gate with a unitary implementation as just described and the query algorithm will function correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the workspace qubits are needed to make this process work — but they are, in fact, returned to their initial states once the combined circuit is executed, so they could be used again as workspace qubits for other purposes.\n",
    "There are strategies that reduce the number of workspace qubits required, but we won't discuss those strategies here."

    "The number $k$ indicates how many workspace qubits are required, and depends on how many gates $C$ has and which ones they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be enough for the purposes of this series, but it is possible to take this one step further when the \n",
    "function $f$ itself is invertible.\n",
    "To be precise, suppose that the function $f$ takes the form $f:\\Sigma^n \\rightarrow \\Sigma^n$, and suppose furthermore there exists a function $f^{-1}$ such that $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for every $x\\in\\Sigma^n$.\n",
    "(The function $f^{-1}$ is necessarily unique when it exists.)\n",
    "\n",

    "To be clear, the fact that this is a unitary operation relies on $f$ being invertible — it's not unitary when $f$ isn't invertible.\n",
    "Disregarding the workspace qubits, $U$ is different from the operation that the circuit $Q$ implements because we're not keeping a copy of the input around and XORing it to an arbitrary string, we're *replacing* $x$ by $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question is: when $f$ is invertible, can we do this?\n",
    "The answer is yes — provided that in addition to having a Boolean circuit that computes $f$, we also have one that computes $f^{-1}$.\n",
    "(So this won't be a shortcut to inverting functions computationally if we don't already know how to do that.)\n",
    "The following diagram illustrates how it can be done by composing two quantum circuits, $Q_f$ and $Q_{f^{-1}}$, which are obtained individually for the functions $f$ and $f^{-1}$ through the method described above.\n",

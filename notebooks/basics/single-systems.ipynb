    "As well as the assumption that $\\Sigma$ is finite, as mentioned earlier, we naturally assume that $\\Sigma$ is nonempty: it is nonsensical for a physical system to have no states at all.\n",
    "Although it does make sense to consider physical systems having infinitely many classical states, we will ignore this possibility for now. There are plenty of interesting ideas to explore even within only a finite number of states.\n",

By measuring a system, we mean that we look at the system and unambiguously recognize whatever classical state it is in. Intuitively, we can never \"see\" a system in a probabilistic state; a measurement will yield exactly one of the allowed classical states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement changes our knowledge of the system, and therefore changes the probabilistic state that we associate with that system: if we recognize that $\\mathsf{X}$ is in the classical state $a\\in\\Sigma$, then the new probability vector representing our knowledge of $\\mathsf{X}$ becomes a vector having a $1$ in the entry corresponding to $a$ and $0$ for all other entries.\n",

    "Vectors of this sort are also called *standard basis* vectors.\n",

    "$|\\text{tails}\\rangle$.\n",
    "This may seem trivial, and in some sense it is. However, quantum systems behave in an entirely analogous way, yet their measurement properties are frequently considered unusual or \"spooky.\" By establishing the measurement properties of classical systems, the analogous behavior for quantum information might seem less unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final remark concerning measurements of probabilistic states: they may describe knowledge or belief, not necessarily something actual.\n",
    "The state of our coin after we flip it, but before we look, is either heads or tails, and we simply do not know which until we look. Doing so does not actually change the state, but only our knowledge of it.\n",
    "Upon seeing that the classical state is tails, we naturally update our knowledge by assigning the vector $|\\text{tails}\\rangle$ to the coin, but to someone else who did not see the coin when it was uncovered, the probabilistic state remains unchanged.\n",

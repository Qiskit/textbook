    "<summary>Alice and Bob</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Alice</em> and <em>Bob</em> are names traditionally given to hypothetical entities or agents in systems, protocols, games, and other interactions that involve the exchange of information.\n",
    "While these are names typically given to humans, it should be understood that they represent abstractions and not necessarily actual human beings — so Alice and Bob might be expected to perform complex computations, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These names were first used in this way in the 1970s in the context of cryptography, but the convention has become common more broadly since then.\n",
    "The idea is simply that these are common names (at least in some parts of the world) that start with the letters A and B.\n",
    "It is also quite convenient to refer to Alice with the pronoun \"her\" and Bob with the pronoun \"him\" for the sake of brevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, we imagine that Alice and Bob are in different locations.\n",
    "They may have different goals and behaviors depending on the context in which they arise.\n",
    "For example, in <em>communication</em>, meaning the transmission of information, we might decide to use the name Alice to refer to the sender and Bob to refer to the receiver of whatever information is transmitted.\n",
    "In general, it may be that Alice and Bob cooperate, which is typical of a wide range of settings — but in other settings they may be in competition, or they may have different goals that may or may not be consistent or harmonious.\n",
    "These things must be made clear in the situation at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also introduce additional characters, such as <em>Charlie</em> and <em>Diane</em>, as needed.\n",
    "Other names that represent different personas, such as <em>Eve</em> for an eavesdropper or <em>Mallory</em> for someone behaving maliciously, are also sometimes used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob appear in all three of the examples to be discussed in this lesson, and we will encounter them from time to time in subsequent lessons.\n",

    "<summary>Entanglement as a resource</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "A few preliminary comments about entanglement are also in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall this example of an entangled quantum state of two qubits from Lesson 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vert \\phi^+ \\rangle = \n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\vert 00\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\vert 11\\rangle.\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the four Bell states, and is often viewed as the archetypal example of an entangled quantum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also encountered this example of a probabilistic state of two bits:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{2} \\vert 00 \\rangle + \\frac{1}{2} \\vert 11 \\rangle.\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is, in some sense, analogous to the entangled quantum state $(1)$.\n",
    "It represents a probabilistic state in which two bits are correlated, but it is not entangled.\n",
    "Entanglement is a uniquely quantum phenomenon, essentially by definition:\n",
    "in simplified terms, entanglement refers to any <em>non-classical</em> quantum correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, defining entanglement as non-classical quantum correlation is somewhat unsatisfying at an intuitive level, because it's a definition of entanglement is in terms of what it is not.\n",
    "It may be for this reason that it's actually rather challenging to explain precisely what entanglement is, and what makes it special, in intuitive terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical explanations of entanglement often fail to distinguish the two states $(1)$ and $(2)$ in a meaningful way.\n",
    "For example, it is sometimes said that if one of two entangled qubits is measured, then the state of the other qubit is somehow instantaneously affected; or that the state of the two qubits together cannot be described separately; or that the two qubits somehow maintain a memory of each other.\n",
    "These statements are not false — but why are they not also true for the unentangled state $(2)$?\n",
    "The two bits represented by this state are intimately connected: each one has a perfect memory of the other in a literal sense.\n",
    "But it is nevertheless not entangled.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to explain what makes entanglement special, and what makes the state $(1)$ very different from the state $(2)$, is to explain what can be done with entanglement, or what we can see happening because of entanglement, that goes beyond the decisions we make about how to represent our knowledge of states using vectors.\n",
    "All three of the examples to be discussed in this lesson have this nature, in that they illustrate things that can be done with the state $(1)$ that cannot be done with <em>any</em> classically correlated state, including the state $(2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, it is typical in the study of quantum information and computation that entanglement is viewed as a resource through which different tasks can be accomplished.\n",
    "When this is done, the state $(1)$ is viewed as representing one <em>unit</em> of entanglement, which we refer to as an <em>e-bit</em>.\n",
    "(The \"e\" stands for \"entangled\" or \"entanglement.\" \n",
    "While it is true that the state $(1)$ is a state of two qubits, the quantity of entanglement that it represents is one e-bit.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Incidentally, we can also view the probabilistic state $(2)$ as a resource, which is one bit of <em>shared randomness</em>.\n",
    "It can be very useful in cryptography, for instance, to share a random bit with somebody (presuming that nobody else knows what the bit is), so that it can be used as a private key (or part of a private key) for the sake of encryption.\n",
    "But in this lesson the focus is on entanglement and a few things we can do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a point of clarification regarding terminology, when we say that Alice and Bob <em>share an e-bit</em>, what we mean is that Alice has a qubit named $\\mathsf{A}$, Bob has a qubit named $\\mathsf{B}$, and together the pair $(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B})$ is in the quantum state $(1)$.\n",
    "Different names could, of course, be chosen for the qubits, but throughout this lesson we will stick with these names in the interest of clarity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Quantum teleportation, or just teleportation for short, is a protocol where a sender (Alice) transmits a qubit to a receiver (Bob) by making use of a shared entangled quantum state (one e-bit, to be specific) along with two bits of classical communication.\n",
    "The name *teleportation* is meant to be suggestive of the concept in science fiction where matter is transported from one location to another by a futuristic process, but it must be understood that matter is not teleported in quantum teleportation — what is actually teleported is quantum information."

    "The set-up for teleportation is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that Alice and Bob share an e-bit: Alice holds a qubit $\\mathsf{A}$, Bob holds a qubit $\\mathsf{B}$, and together the pair $(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B})$ is in the state $\\vert\\phi^+\\rangle.$\n",
    "It could be, for instance, that Alice and Bob were in the same location in the past, they prepared the qubits $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{B}$ in the state $\\vert \\phi^+ \\rangle,$ and then each went their own way with their qubit in hand.\n",
    "Or, it could be that a different process, such as one involving a third party or a complex distributed process, was used to establish this shared e-bit.\n",
    "These details are not part of the teleportation protocol itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice then comes into possession of a third qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ that she wishes to transmit to Bob.\n",
    "The state of the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ is considered to be *unknown* to Alice and Bob, and no assumptions are made about it.\n",
    "For example, the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ might be entangled with one or more other systems that neither Alice nor Bob can access. \n",
    "To say that Alice wishes to transmit the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ to Bob means that Alice would like Bob to be holding a qubit that is in the same state that $\\mathsf{Q}$ was in at the start of the protocol, having whatever correlations that $\\mathsf{Q}$ had with other systems, as if Alice had physically handed $\\mathsf{Q}$ to Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can, of course, imagine that Alice physically sends the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ to Bob, and presuming that $\\mathsf{Q}$ reaches Bob without being altered or disturbed in transit, Alice and Bob's task will be accomplished.\n",
    "In the context of teleportation, however, it is our assumption that it is not possible for Alice to physically send $\\mathsf{Q}$ to Bob.\n",
    "She may, however, send classical information to Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are reasonable assumptions in a variety of settings.\n",
    "For example, if Alice does not know Bob's exact location, or the distance between them is large, physically sending a qubit using the technology of today, or the foreseeable future, would be challenging to say the least.\n",
    "However, as we know from everyday experiences, classical information transmission under these circumstances is quite straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, one might ask whether it is possible for Alice and Bob to accomplish their task without even needing to make use of a shared e-bit.\n",
    "In other words, is there any way to transmit a qubit using classical communication alone?\n",
    "The answer is no, it is not possible to transmit quantum information using classical communication alone.\n",
    "This is not too difficult to prove using basic quantum information theory covered in the third unit of this series — but for now, an intuitive way to rule out the possibility of transmitting qubits using classical communication alone is to think about the no-cloning theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that there was a way to send quantum information using classical communication alone.\n",
    "Classical information can easily be copied and broadcast, which means that any classical transmission from Alice to Bob might also potentially be received by a second receiver (Charlie, let us say).\n",

    "![Teleportation circuit](images/entanglement-in-action/teleportation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram is slightly stylized in that it depicts the separation between Alice and Bob, with two diagonal wires representing classical bits that are sent from Alice to Bob, but otherwise it is an ordinary quantum circuit diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, the teleportation protocol is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice performs a controlled-NOT operation on the pair $(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{Q})$, with $\\mathsf{Q}$ being the control and $\\mathsf{A}$ being the target, and then performs a Hadamard operation on $\\mathsf{Q}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alice then measures both $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{Q}$, with respect to a standard basis measurement in both cases, and transmits the classical outcomes to Bob. Let us refer to the outcome of the measurement of $\\mathsf{A}$ as $a$ and the outcome of the measurement of $\\mathsf{Q}$ as $b$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Bob receives $a$ and $b$ from Alice, and depending on the values of these bits he performs these operations:\n",
    "   - If $a = 1$, then Bob performs a bit flip (or $X$ gate) on his qubit $\\mathsf{B}$.\n",
    "   - If $b = 1$, then Bob performs a phase flip (or $Z$ gate) on his qubit $\\mathsf{B}$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   That is, conditioned on $ab$ being $00$, $01$, $10$, or $11$, Bob performs one of the operations $\\mathbb{1},$ $Z,$ $X,$ or $ZX$ on the qubit $\\mathsf{B}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the complete description of the teleportation protocol.\n",
    "The analysis that appears below reveals that when it is run, the qubit $\\mathsf{B}$ will be in whatever state $\\mathsf{Q}$ was in prior to the protocol being executed, including whatever correlations it had with any other systems — which is to say that the protocol has effectively implemented a perfect qubit communication channel, where the state of $\\mathsf{Q}$ has been \"teleported\" into $\\mathsf{B}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding to the analysis, notice that this protocol does not succeed in cloning the state of $\\mathsf{Q}$, which we already know is impossible by the no-cloning theorem.\n",
    "Rather, when the protocol is finished, the state of the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ will have changed from its original value to $\\vert b\\rangle$ as a result of the measurement performed on it.\n",
    "Also notice that the e-bit has effectively been \"burned\" in the process: the state of $\\mathsf{A}$ has changed to $\\vert a\\rangle$ and is no longer entangled with $\\mathsf{B}$ (or any other system).\n",

    "### 1.3 Further discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few brief, concluding remarks on teleportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it should be understood that teleportation is not an *application* of quantum information, it's a protocol\n",
    "for performing *quantum communication*.\n",
    "It is only useful insofar as quantum communication is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it is reasonable to speculate that teleportation could one day become a standard way to communicate quantum information, perhaps through a process known as *entanglement distillation*.\n",
    "This is a process that converts a larger number of noisy (or imperfect) e-bits into a smaller number of high-quality e-bits, that could then be used for noiseless or near-noiseless teleportation.\n",
    "The idea is that the process of entanglement distillation is not as delicate as direct quantum communication.\n",
    "We could accept losses, for instance, and if the process doesn't work out, then we can just try again.\n",
    "In contrast, the actual qubits we hope to communicate might be much more precious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the idea behind teleportation and the way that it works is quite fundamental in quantum information and computation.\n",
    "It is a cornerstone of quantum information theory, and variations on the idea also often arise.\n",
    "As just one example, quantum gates can be implemented using teleportation, but where different initial states and measurements are chosen so that the outcome is to apply a chosen *operation* rather than to communicate."

    "Superdense coding is a protocol that, in some sense, achieves a complementary aim to teleportation.\n",
    "Rather than allowing for the transmission of one qubit using two classical bits of communication (at the cost of one e-bit of entanglement), it allows for the transmission of two classical bits using one qubit of quantum communication (again, at the cost of one e-bit of entanglement).\n",
    "\n",
    "In greater detail, we have a sender (Alice) and a receiver (Bob) that share one e-bit of entanglement.\n",

    "Sending qubits is likely to be so much more difficult than sending classical bits for the foreseeable future that trading one qubit of quantum communication for two bits of classical communication, at the cost of an e-bit no less, hardly seems worth it.\n",
    "However, this does not imply that superdense coding is not interesting, for it most certainly is.\n",

    "They did not describe the example as a game, but rather as an experiment.\n",
    "It's description as a game, however, is both natural and intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CHSH game falls within a class of games known as *nonlocal games*.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Nonlocal games\n",
    "\n",
    "A nonlocal game is a *cooperative game* where two players, Alice and Bob, work together to achieve a particular outcome.\n",
    "The game is run by a *referee*, who behaves according to strict guidelines that are known to Alice and Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob can prepare for the game however they choose, but once the game starts they are *forbidden from communicating*.\n",
    "We might imagine the game taking place in a secure facility of some sort — as if the referee is playing the role of a detective and Alice and Bob are suspects being interrogated in different rooms.\n",
    "But another way of thinking about the set-up is that Alice and Bob are separated by a vast distance, and communication is prohibited because the speed of light doesn't allow for it within the running time of the game.\n",
    "That is to say, if Alice tries to send a message to Bob, the game will be over by the time he receives it, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cartoon showing Alice being interrogated by a detective. The detective asks Alice where she was the night of 'x=0', she points to a whiteboard and responds \"I can tell you with 85% confidence I was with Bob\". Caption: The CHSH officer was surprisingly unphased by Alice measuring qubits in the interrogation room.](images/entanglement-in-action/chsh-cartoon.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The way a nonlocal game works is that the referee first asks each of Alice and Bob a question.\n",
    "We'll use the letter $x$ to refer to Alice's question and $y$ to refer to Bob's question.\n",
    "Here we're thinking of $x$ and $y$ as being classical states, and in the CHSH game $x$ and $y$ are bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The referee uses *randomness* to select these questions.\n",
    "To be precise, there is some probability $p(x,y)$ associated with each possible pair $(x,y)$ of questions, and the referee has vowed to choose the questions, at the time of the game, in this way.\n",
    "Everyone, including Alice and Bob, knows these probabilities — but nobody knows specifically which pair $(x,y)$ will be chosen until the game begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Alice and Bob receive their questions, they must then provide answers: Alice's answer is $a$ and Bob's answer is $b$.\n",
    "Again, these are classical states in general, and bits in the CHSH game.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point the referee makes a decision: Alice and Bob either *win* or *lose* depending on whether or not the pair of answers $(a,b)$ is deemed correct for the pair of questions $(x,y)$ according to some fixed set of rules.\n",
    "Different rules mean different games, and the rules for the CHSH game specifically are described in the section following this one.\n",

    "It is the uncertainty about which questions will be asked, and specifically the fact that each player doesn't know the other player's question, that makes nonlocal games challenging for Alice and Bob — just like colluding suspects in different rooms trying to keep their story straight.\n",
    "\n",
    "A precise description of the referee defines an instance of a nonlocal game.\n",
    "This includes a specification of the probabilities $p(x,y)$ for each question pair along with the rules\n",

    "### 3.3 Limitation of classical strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider strategies for Alice and Bob in the CHSH game, beginning with *classical* strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deterministic strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with *deterministic* strategies, where Alice's answer $a$ is a function of the question $x$ that she receives, and likewise Bob's answer $b$ is a function of the question $y$ he receives.\n",
    "So, for instance, we may write $a(0)$ to represent Alice's answer when her question is $0$, and $a(1)$ to represent Alice's answer when her question is $1.$\n",
    "\n",
    "No deterministic strategy can possibly win the CHSH game every time.\n",
    "One way to reason this is simply to go one-by-one through all of the possible deterministic strategies and check that every one of them loses for at least one of the four possible question pairs.\n",
    "Alice and Bob can each choose from four possible functions from one bit to one bit — which we encountered in Lesson 1 — and so there are $16$ different deterministic strategies in total to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also reason this fact analytically.\n",
    "If Alice and Bob's strategy wins when $(x,y) = (0,0)$, then it must be that $a(0) = b(0);$\n",
    "if their strategy wins for $(x,y) = (0,1),$ we conclude that $a(0) = b(1);$ and similarly,\n",
    "if the strategy wins for $(x,y)=(1,0)$ then $a(1) = b(0).$\n",
    "So, if their strategy wins for all three possibilities, then we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b(1) = a(0) = b(0) = a(1).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that the strategy loses in the final case $(x,y) = (1,1),$ for here winning requires that \n",
    "$a(1) \\not= b(1).$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, there can be no deterministic strategy that wins every time.\n",
    "It is quite straightforward to identify strategies that win in three of the four cases \n",
    "(such as $a(0)=a(1)=b(0)=b(1)=0$), and so we see that the maximum probability for Alice and Bob to win using a deterministic strategy is $3/4.$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probabilistic strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "As we just concluded, Alice and Bob cannot do better than winning the CHSH game 75% of the time using a deterministic strategy.\n",
    "But what about a probabilistic strategy?\n",
    "Could it help Alice and Bob to use randomness — including the possibility of *shared randomness*, where their random choices are correlated?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that probabilistic strategies don't help at all to increase the probability that Alice and Bob win.\n",
    "This is because every probabilistic strategy can alternatively be viewed as a random selection of a deterministic strategy, just like (as was mentioned in the first lesson) probabilistic operations can be viewed as random selections of deterministic operations.\n",
    "The average is never larger than the maximum, and so it follows that probabilistic strategies don't offer any advantage in terms of their overall winning probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, winning with probability $3/4$ is the best that Alice and Bob can do using any classical strategy, whether deterministic or probabilistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 CHSH game strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural question to ask at this point is whether Alice and Bob can do any better using a *quantum* strategy.\n",
    "In particular, if they share an entangled quantum state as the following figure suggests, which they could have prepared prior to playing the game, can they increase their winning probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Nonlocal game with entanglement](images/entanglement-in-action/nonlocal-game-entanglement2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is \"yes,\" and this is the main point of the example and why it's so interesting.\n",

    "### 3.5 Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of an experiment like the CHSH game, where entanglement leads to statistical results that are inconsistent with any classical description, is due to John Bell, the namesake of the Bell states.\n",
    "For this reason, people often refer to experiments of this sort as *Bell tests*.\n",
    "Sometimes people also refer to *Bell's theorem*, which can be formulated in different ways — but the essence of it is that quantum mechanics is not compatible with so-called *local hidden variable theories*.\n",
    "The CHSH game is a very nice and clean example of a Bell test, and can be viewed as a proof, or demonstration, of Bell's theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CHSH game offers us one way to experimentally test that the theory of quantum information is an accurate theory.\n",
    "Experiments can be performed that implement the CHSH game, and test the sorts of strategies based on entanglement described above.\n",
    "This provides us with a high degree of confidence that entanglement is real — and unlike the sometimes vague or poetic ways that we come up with to explain entanglement, the CHSH game gives us a concrete and testable way to *observe* entanglement.\n",
    "The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics acknowledges the importance of this line of work: the prize was awarded to Alain Aspect, John Clauser (the C in CHSH) and Anton Zeilinger, for observing entanglement through Bell tests on entangled photons."

    "For the sake of convenience and brevity, we will hereafter use the term *classical state set* to mean any finite and nonempty set.\n",
    "\n",

    "In general, we can represent a probabilistic state of a system having any classical state set in the same way, as a vector of probabilities.\n",
    "The probabilities can be ordered in any way we choose — which is typically determined by some natural or default way to order the classical state set we're working with. To be precise, we can represent any probabilistic state through a column vector satisfying two properties:\n",

    "### Measuring probabilistic states\n",

    "Now let us briefly consider what happens if we *measure* a system when it is in a probabilistic state. By measuring a system, we mean that we look at the system and unambiguously recognize whatever classical state it is in. Intuitively, we can never \"see\" a system in a probabilistic state; a measurement will yield exactly one of the allowed classical states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement changes our knowledge of the system, and therefore changes the probabilistic state that we associate with that system: if we recognize that $\\mathsf{X}$ is in the classical state $a\\in\\Sigma$, then the new probability vector representing our knowledge of $\\mathsf{X}$ becomes a vector having a $1$ in the entry corresponding to $a$ and $0$ for all other entries.\n",
    "This vector indicates that $\\mathsf{X}$ is in the classical state $a$ with certainty, which we know having just recognized it.\n",

    "Vectors of this sort are also called *standard basis* vectors.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to uncover the coin and look at it, we would see one of the two classical states: heads or tails.\n",

    "$|\\text{tails}\\rangle.$\n",
    "This may seem trivial, and in some sense it is. However, quantum systems behave in an entirely analogous way, yet their measurement properties are frequently considered unusual or \"spooky.\" By establishing the measurement properties of classical systems, the analogous behavior for quantum information might seem less unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final remark concerning measurements of probabilistic states: they may describe knowledge or belief, not necessarily something actual.\n",
    "The state of our coin after we flip it, but before we look, is either heads or tails, and we simply don't know which until we look. \n",
    "Doing so doesn't actually change the state, but only our knowledge of it.\n",
    "Upon seeing that the classical state is tails, we naturally update our knowledge by assigning the vector $|\\text{tails}\\rangle$ to the coin, but to someone else who didn't see the coin when it was uncovered, the probabilistic state remains unchanged.\n",

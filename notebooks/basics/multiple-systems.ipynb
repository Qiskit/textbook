    "If $\\mathsf{Y}$ happened to be in a distant location, say, another galaxy, this would allow for faster-than-light signaling, which we reject based on our understanding of physics. Another way to understand this comes from an interpretation of probability as reflecting a degree of belief about the state of the system. Since a measurement on $\\mathsf{Y}$ is taken to simply reveal a preexisting state, a different observer looking at $\\mathsf{X}$, unaware of the $\\mathsf{Y}$ measurement, should not have their probabilities changed.\n",

    "By default, `measure` measures all qubits in the state vector, but we can provide a list of integers to only measure the qubits at those indices. To demonstrate, the cell below creates the state $W = \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|001\\rangle + |010\\rangle + |100\\rangle)$.\n",

You can override this by passing a `dims` argument to the constructor. For example, `dims=(4,2)` would tell Qiskit the system has one four-level system, and one two-level system (qubit)."

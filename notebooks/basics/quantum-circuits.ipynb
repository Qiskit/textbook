    "\n",
    "The second remark is that the no-cloning theorem is a statement about the impossibility of cloning an *arbitrary* state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "We can easily create a clone of any standard basis state, for instance.\n",

    "\n",
    "While there is no difficulty in creating a clone of a standard basis state, this does not contradict the no-cloning theorem — this approach of using a controlled-NOT gate would not succeed in creating a clone of the state $\\vert + \\rangle$, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final remark about the no-cloning theorem is that it really isn't unique to quantum information, it's also impossible to clone an arbitrary probabilistic state using a classical (deterministic or probabilistic) process.\n",
    "This is pretty intuitive.\n",
    "Imagine someone hands you a system in some probabilistic state, but you're not sure what that probabilistic state is.\n",
    "For example, maybe they randomly generated a number between $1$ and $10$, but they didn't tell you how they generated that number.\n",
    "There's certainly no physical process through which you can obtain two *independent* copies of that same probabilistic state: all you have in your hands is a number between $1$ and $10$, and there just isn't enough information present for you to somehow reconstruct the probabilities for all of the other outcomes to appear.\n",
    "Mathematically speaking, a version of the no-cloning theorem for probabilistic states can be proved in exactly the same way as the regular no-cloning theorem (for quantum states).\n",
    "That is, cloning an arbitrary probabilistic state is a non-linear process, so it cannot possibly be represented by a stochastic matrix."

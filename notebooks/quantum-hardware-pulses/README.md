These notebooks are the source files for the _Investigating Quantum Hardware
using Microwave Pulses_ chapter of the Qiskit Textbook.

## Overview

The Qiskit Textbook mostly assumes we have a quantum computer that can carry
out quantum operations, and doesn't worry about how the devices actually work.
These pages go a step deeper, exploring the physics of superconducting qubits,
and using Qiskit to program operations on these devices at the level of
microwave pulses.
